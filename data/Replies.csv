Deleting more posts doesn’t equal more moderation. I scroll once and start seeing stuff from yesterday and it’s pretty boring. I fully understand removing pull posts or those unfunny memes but relax. Even if it might be like “who should I upgrade next or who is best or for pvp or the red demon” they should be allowed so it’s not the Sahara desert with 3hrs between posts. Also “browse the megathread” seems like a shitty response cuz that’s seeing a bunch of comments and the format isn’t that nice. Also every sub I’ve been in has atleast messaged when they take your posts down but y’all don’t even do that unless it’s from the auto mod. Sometimes it says it’s posted but doesn’t show up and I’ve seen different people comment that too. I might get downvoted but idk how y’all can browse a sub with barely any new content`-12.0`2020-09-15 02:35:14`0.0
"I have a feeling the sub could do better as well and in all fairness, I would like to help/apply, as I have experience with mod (/r/future\_fight) alongside other communities outside of reddit. Yet, I feel like this would be a big, big, big shore for me. I have worked for communities with over 100k people before, and I can most definitely lend a hand, but that is if you'd be keen as well on taking people onboard for sporadic help like design/visuals, consultive opinion, etc. I believe that, close to my 30's, leading a guild and plenty of other irl responsibilities, I would be able to commit many hours a week or do half of what you did. :c

">This means I wouldn't necessarily like any kind of mod role/tools/access, but rather be here/be present on Discord if any help is deemed necessary.

No offense but this sounds like you’re saying you’d like to be a mod, not have to do anything, but be there to give opinions on things like the direction of the sub lol. Unfortunately that’s actually what I’d say half of the people who sign up to moderate do. They think subs like this aren’t going to take much work and they’ll just sit back to give criticism or unwanted guidance to the other mods who do the work. That causes huge problems and splinters the team which needs to be cohesive. 

I don’t mean this to be mean to you. I’m just saying that being a mod is going to mean putting work in. If you can’t dedicate a few hours a week to it then you probably shouldn’t do the job. Because it is a job. A thankless unpaid job where more than not the community will judge you harshly for what you do."`7.0`2020-09-15 08:27:13`0.0
"If being moderator feels like a chore or a hassle before you are even one, I feel you might start it off from the wrong foot.

From my own experience, and to anyone interested, be a moderator if you feel passionate about the game but mostly about the community. Else, you'll burn yourself out within months.

It's a unique experience and I recommend many people try it, but with the right intentions: be an example, be a guide for those who want guidance and be a friend for those who you work with. You'll face toxicity and you'll put in effort not everyone will appreciate. But you'll matter for those who don't always know it.

If I had the time, and the connection to this community as I did with others, I'd happily apply, but my priorities in life are elsewhere now."`3.0`2020-09-15 07:17:30`0.0

I feel you. I apologize for my wording. As I have replied above, I know about all of this very, very well.

I was very unfortunate with my wording. I mean shore in a sense that I could not dedicate many hours to read through topics and act fast upon reports. This does take time, I know it. I know it very well in fact. My intentions were not bad at all. In fact, I have designed, for instance, Marvel's Future Fight reddit (on old reddit layout) basing myself on the entire game UI. I am quite skilled with design and this is where I believe I could support the reddit the most and wouldn't mind if my opinion (given my background and experience) would be needed here and there, so, in short, I am just putting out that I am volunteering myself to help, mostly with UI, if needed.`2.0`2020-09-15 08:55:19`0.0

"I have some clarification questions about the NY/Valentine units. I managed to pull 5 of 6 of them, all the girls, only missing GDM. My questions are:

1.	With the Valentine units, do they need to be active on my team with their cosmetics active as well, in order to get the extra cosmetic drop? Or just having them works? Basically just need to know if I need to fully build them for my demon team.
2.	Is it worth even buying the cosmetics for the NY units? I only got the Red and Gray demon ones, and I really wanted GDMeli for Howlex. Getting random demon spawns doesn’t really matter much to me at this point, as I probably can’t even beat a Hell Demon currently, my team CC is around 155k.
3.	Since I can’t really even beat a Hell demon, should I even worry about any cosmetics, even for the Valentine’s units? I assume they’ll eventually come back around, maybe during the actual New Years and Valentines Day holidays, and by then I may be more ready to face Hell demons. Right now to buy just the Valentine’s cosmetics, it would cost me 150 diamonds, which I’m trying to save for Goddess Liz or Eastin banners.
4.	I guess my biggest all around question is, since I already invested the diamonds in pulling 5 of the 6 units, should I buy all the cosmetics for them? Or save the rest of the diamonds I have left for future banners?"`2.0`2020-09-17 09:27:48`1.0

Depends on the character... If it's a DPS unit like derieri, or R.Esca or LV meli (characters like those, its better to go att/def with att/def/hp substats, otherwise just use Hp/def with att/def/hp substats to help you increase the cc team

For normal Pvp, every point matters (i.e. you have a 40k 6/6 ult association character, it will give 4000 cc points, 4 association characters in total means 16,000 cc), plus an additional 1000 cc if it has a combined attack (total of 20,000)

So yes, it does matters WHEN your main team is already maxed out... otherwise my recommendation is to keep maxing your team :)"`1.0`2020-09-17 05:56:30`1.0

A1 quit mid production bc movie did not drop enough money, publisher decided to get a new studio but stick with the old release date, result: Studio that had never drawn nanatsu no taizai style before had to finish 24 episode in almost no time, in an arc that has fights like meli vs esca. Sure some frames are bad, but those shown here are literally one frame. I mean the meli lying in his bed is literally one frame. Everything else looks fine, given they had no time and no experience. Also, Studio Deen drawing seems closer to the manga. Probs to them for creating season 3 in such a short time, the old animation studio quitting because a movie did not give enough money is the bigger fail for me.`6.0`2020-09-16 23:17:41`4.0

We likely are all biased based on what we saw first. But I see uneccesary hate on the dub for this anime. In Youtube comments I got shit for even suggesting GC add in the english voices as an option (I mean the DBZ games can do it). To me, who has seen most of the manga as well as everything animated, the voices are pefect for most characters. All the Sins feel right to me. Meliodas has a unique, youthful voice. Ban is kind of the “cool” one, best way I can describe it. King sounds insecure, unsure of himself. Merlin has a sultry voice, Gowther has a sort of “disconnected” voice where it comes more from analysis than as a thought itself. Diane fits fine and Escanor is perfect. I guess the only minor complaint I have is Elizabeth but not because of the performance but she just sounds like every female Mary Sue protagonist ever, but I guess that’s a character issue not the VA issue. Hawk just annoys the shit outta me tbh.`2.0`2020-09-17 05:47:57`4.0

"I totally agree with you.

I'm the kind of person who never farmed that much so i don't have 1 Perfect gear set for each different Hero.  
I can kill every demon, also soloed every hell except Red, but it's a torture to wait like 3 minutes each time because the allies have to switch gear... And it's a more dramatic torture to be the one who has to switch gear! You try to be faster, but you are always worried that the other quit the room because he's tired of waiting.  
And then, if you manage to switch gear on your main 4, you cannot switch gear on supports. It's like running with a broken leg.

Presets are a reality in the vast majority of games, also in those where it's not even needed.  
It's like a basic feature, saving a lot of time and making players enjoy each second of the game. I know people who don't even do extreme or hell demons anymore because they are tired to switch gear set every 2 seconds.

We need something like the 5 ""team spots"" but where you can save also the equipment.  
Let's say, i want to use team number 1, when i select that one i will use pg saved with the gear they had when i saved the team pre-selection last time.

"If they don't want to do fixed teams with assigned fixed gear sets (which would be the best for players imo) I think a good compromise would be to have swapping gear before a piece of content work like it does in death match where you can hit the arrow on the gear screen and it only cycles between characters you have on the team. They just *really* ought to include association units when you're cycling through. So annoying you can't really swap gear on associations in death match efficiently.

It would also be nice to have some way to indicate substat rolls for gear sets on the ""Exchange Equipment"" screen but it may be hard to do that without it getting too cluttered."`3.0`2020-09-17 05:04:20`8.0

"This kind of feature becomes redundant after you've played for a while as you will start to gear out multiple characters so you almost never have to swap gear.

I do agree it would nice as I remember how irritating it was when starting out. However they could just improve the fluidity and responsiveness to make it quicker and easier at the very least. The awkward UI for gear swapping is more of a problem than not having a better preset system.

I personally would prefer a system where gear sets can be equipped by multiple characters at the same time as long as they set to a different team. So for example you create a gear set and you can assign it to team 1 meliodas and also geared PvP team deri. That way you never need to swap unless you edit the team or something. You would have a cap or something so it can only be used by 2-3 teams at a time."`1.0`2020-09-17 13:30:31`8.0
"Adding this QoL feature for you, is closing down a revenue stream for netmarble. Every 2 weeks since this game released on global, probably since JP, this same idea is posted over and over again. Netmarble knows you want it, but it wont happen. 

They want you to make a set for every character. Early on they sell you individual R SR and SSR sets, then they sell you upgrade packs with anvils and hammers.

"If I'm thinking of it the way you're describing, this would mean people wouldn't need to create a gear set for each character anymore they would just slap the same set on multiple characters but for different types of content?

Sounds to me like this is something moneymarble with their aggresive anvil, hammer and gear packs would never implement. I feel like they purposely make it annoying to swap around so that you have to pay for the convenience of not worrying about it and setting up each individual character cause most games already do function this way without a hard emphasis on monetizing equipment items.."`6.0`2020-09-17 02:57:30`8.0
"The reason it was easier for them to implement is that it just snapshots the gear you tell it to use and then just uses that exact team if a player is to meet a bot in top 100. It doesn't actually move the gear around. 

That said... People have made gear outfitter mods for games like WoW for free that could give prompts when it can't find a piece of gear. Need more whales asking for this somehow, but lot of them have extra gear that they don't ever feel the need to shuffle around full sets to beat something like a Hell Demon."`1.0`2020-09-17 09:21:48`8.0

I would argue due to the UR equipment system you would still need to make gear seats for the characters you plan to use a lot since the bonus is character specific. This would make it easier to swap equipment around but you wouldn’t just have 4 hp/def set and 4 attack/def set for your whole box. If I understand your point though I do get that a lot of people make multiple sets for convince of not having to to swap around. But UR system would still require you to make a lot of sets`6.0`2020-09-17 03:30:33`8.0
"Again, the point is to push you to make or buy a complete set for every character. Having UR sets go back to their original owners would make things convenient, maybe convenient enough that some people wouldnt spend the money making extra sets...

Dont get me wrong, I would love the feature, but this is my explanation as to why I think Netmarble hasnt included it."`1.0`2020-09-17 00:56:44`8.0
Yes I agree with what you're saying, and that's mostly what I'm trying to get at, the current equipment system is made to encourage creating multiple sets and you can speed up the process by throwing money at the game, hence why UR gear grants bonuses to only one character so in a way you can't just make 4 UR sets and rotate em around your teams. Imo it's not a QoL problem, it's a monetization problem, as long as they can get people to buy the equipment packs, they have very little reason to try and make equipment setups more convenient for the player.`3.0`2020-09-17 03:37:58`8.0
Do you *honestly * think this, that players will go the extreme of making +5 awaken UR sets for every character they use just because of the inconvenience of using exchange sets every time they want to swapped gear? The amount of time it takes to +5/awake sets for all character to use will probably be greater than the lifetime you will waste exchanging sets -_-`3.0`2020-09-17 01:12:33`8.0
"But the point is that we can already switch UR gear to other characters, just losing the UR bonus. You don't need to downgrade them back to ssr to switch them.


I'd agree with you in case we couldn't switch them but it isn't like that. It's just a missing auto switch feature, pure QOL (quality of life). It means that adding it doesn't ruin any balance in the game but makes the game smoother to play."`1.0`2020-09-17 01:03:13`8.0
Ahh yea I get what you’re saying. Even though you would still need multiple sets for characters for specific subsats (e.g pierce for howzer and lilia) it wouldn’t be as high as it is with the UR system`1.0`2020-09-17 03:39:52`8.0
"Most of the characters I use have their own 5star ssr sets. The substats of my less used chars aren't perfect, but good enough for most content.

7 or 8 have 4 pieces of UR gear... The only time I switch gear is between 2 versions of the same character... rEsca to gEsca and so forth... and KH boss.

"That would be my usual instinct too, normally, but I really wonder two things: 

first, are those drops really that helpful when you're already at the stage where you're beating hell demons? Seems to me all they really do is increase the rarity of costumes, and if you already have 5 UR pieces registered... who cares? (Unless I'm misunderstanding the function - I saw that it said increases stats, but I just assumed that meant  'increased to the point of what the upgraded rarity would normally give').

Second, you CAN get the item drops in other ways (random from extreme, and events, currently).  If I play until I'm strong enough for Hell demons anyway, will I have naturally farmed as many of the fabric pieces as I might need along the way anyway?

Seems like these outfits are diminishing returns over time: eventually you'll just have all the upgrade pieces you need. The the value of the costume is literally zero (beyond aesthetics.... and these are kinda meh...)."`-2.0`2020-09-16 09:37:59`12.0

LV doesn't really shine without like 3 sets of purchased cosmetics, and you ideally want 3+/6 and UR gear. At which point you could climb all the way to Champ 1 in both PVP modes. 900 diamonds on his banner doesn't even reasonably guarantee you that, and you still need to buy all the cosmetics with money or diamonds. 

The OP I was criticizing was saying this banner sucks is worst because you need to buy 60 diamonds of cosmetics to get the units online, and you do only have 2 weeks to buy them to have them active for the next few months... That said. You only need 1 copy of each, and you only need 60 diamonds of cosmetics, and level 60 to get the full effect. 900 Diamonds on this banner almost guarantees you can get all 3.

With the hell demons comes 6 new characters, who were seasonal in the JP version. The New Legend heroes + their respective costumes will guarantee the Death Match Boss of your choice, and the Sweet Temptation heroes + their costumes will give you extra costume enhance materials ([and yep, that's a thing now, too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsYBtfQ3QDo)). Raids and drops will happen regardless, and the units are likely to be back during the holidays when they were originally introduced (New Years + Valetine's Day), so if you're strictly F2P this could be a skip banner for you.

You can. With Recovery disable you cannot use Recovery skills (Green sparkle on the card), but can recover HP, like with Lifesteal, with Infect you cannot recover HP,  but can use Recovery skills, and cleanse it. And in case with Liz's Ult, if it doesn't recover health it doesn't fill Ult orbs.`2.0`2020-09-17 04:07:26`25.0

Because bringing a buffer buffs everybody's ulti damage as well? Gil's own ulti isnt that bad either. It all depends on what you run, if you run gescas then obviously theres no reason to bring buffs but if you run gkings then a buffer would be useful. 

Gking literally works the same way as gesca on first phase cuz gesca cant hit grey, the only difference is gesca can elegant blow when phase 2 shield is down for slightly faster ulti charge.

I honestly hate how people like you get down voted. Its crazy to me. You are the only reasonable person here. The entire business models of gachas are scummy by nature but this is what people sign up for when they play them. This is how they make money. They drain your resources and then unleash cool shit in order to entice you to spend cash. Whales will whale and keep the game going for everyone else. This isn't unique to 7DS...its the way of the business model. There is more than enough resources in the game obtainable every month to save for big ass hype banners (like the festival ones) that have all the units people are blowing hundreds (or thousands) of gems on and failing to get one copy of the unit they want. But no...they pull on every banner with the little they have and complain every week things are moving too fast or they blew it all on LV meli and are now complaining they can't get these units. How the hell do you think this company is supposed to make money if they don't keep your resources drained? Just skip these units and save if your F2P or don't spend a lot. There terrible units and they add VERY LITTLE QoL to the game. An extra mat every time you host/kill a hell demon is NOTHING. The majority of those materials will come from events for F2P`20.0`2020-09-16 10:45:00`31.0
Tbh I agree with you in this regard. I mean it's all a gamble right. Moreover they are asking money (a lot I mean) but still compared to other games they are really generous for f2p too.

The fact your defending them is worse. They barely gave us time to save for lv,then release a banner with a unit that a lot didn’t have so they went for her,then release 6 new units,and cosmetics for them. They gave out event cosmetics before so the fact they didn’t is greedy 100%.

"  It is just interesting how white knights are defending NM saying, well, it’s a gacha game, is greedy/scummy by nature. It’s a business, you know, therefore you, players, have no right to complain.

I have question here then. Since then, being a business to make money becomes an excuse to be scummy?  Means, NM has right to be scummy/greedy/exploiting gambling player weaknesses, because its business, but you players has no right to say about this anything. Just be grateful they let you play their game.

I payed money in this game, and as a customer, if I am not happy with something, I will speak. That’s it.

Oh, wait, says, shiny white knight, they give you so many stuff for “free”, you have to be grateful for that and shut up. Well, believe me, they give free stuff to player not out of their kind heart. They know, without this “free” stuff people will stop playing this game at all. 

There are many people working there, calculating how to give players very minimum of the resources, just only enough to keep players in the game, but not good enough to progress.

As a mobile game, it’s the best, picture, graphics are the top. I love this game, even if its “gacha”. I am ready to stop any moment, if I feel this game too much for me. I will handle it.

Ok 300 gems is still 300 gems that a lot of people won’t have. I love this game and they have a better model than most. But how fast global is and what they release together is  just absurd. They did lv,then a banner with what’s her face (green robot arms) that is on barely any banners,then 6 new limited units with 300 gems if cosmetics. 90% of f2p players won’t even come close to getting half of that if their lucky`1.0`2020-09-16 08:08:12`31.0
"""They barely gave us time to save for"" thats precisely the point. if you could save for every banner how the f would they make money? and thats where p2w and f2p spli ways. else you save for x unit by ignoring x other banners else you pay.

plus those units/cosmetics already came back on jp so its not like its a one time deal.

The flaw to that is even if you save, a lot of people still don’t get the character. So the fact they give such little time to save is just overkill that most wont get the characters.

And a lot of f2p didn’t find out until maybe 3 months in advance. I was able to save up roughly 60ish gems a week or more so I had 1000+ easily. But then they release limited time units back to back,including cosmetics. That’s why I say their greedy right now. Instead of giving out like you said 10 cosmetics in total which they have before they decide to release them with other very wanted characters.

"Thats a matter of perspective, really...

Sure, gems are more rare on honkai, but 90% of the valkyries are farmable (as are some of the weapons and stigmata too).

Second, the banners all carry a 81 limit for pitty pulls (81 single pulls), meaning that after that amount, you get the featured valkyrie guaranteed (same for weapons), plus that pity carries over between banners... for example, all the pulls i did that didnt give me the rank s valkyries carried over, and then when the herscheer of thunder banner dropped i just needed 10 pulls to get her guaranteed....

Plus, the game is consitently giving free valkyries handouts... the most recent one will be the molotov cherry rank s valkyrie that will come during the anniversary, she will be gifted to all players in anticipation for her augment core, yet another thing that honkai does better than 7ds, augment cores are new forms that valkyries receive that gives them an entire rework, and for that you just need to have the valkyrie, the materials are all farmable (or plain gifted if its during the release of the augment core)..."`1.0`2020-09-17 11:16:34`31.0

Though Global has been pacing a bit too fast, we still have a few banners left. Even if they do banners every week we still should have at minimum 10 to 11 weeks worth of banner before Goddess Eli. Just on top of my head, we have 3 OC's remaining, Halloween units, Gloxinia and a few more. While not sure about Winged King I most likely think Goddess Eli will be for New Years.`1.0`2020-09-16 17:49:02`32.0
When I mean non linear I just mean re-ordering not necessarily different content. Also this notion of global vs jp team is kind of silly there is really only one team which is making the game and translating. You could call the translators the global team but that is a weird partition. Somehow people like to think a different set of people make  make jp decisions and a different set make the global ones. When in reality they will be one and the same. The decisions are different because their data shows how they can monetize differently in different markets.`3.0`2020-09-16 15:16:46`32.0

"For me, pulling only for those units and buying their costume isn't worth it.

Sure you will get faster upgrade materials, but not that fast, unless you grind demons all day.

You just have to be smart about it at first, like with hammer/anvil. Keep a few to upgrade newer units. 

Eventually, we will get more and more materials from events and the units will return in other banners.

In the other hand though LV isn't mandatory either. He's very good, kinda OP with a few ult lvl, but it's more about the whole banner. 
All in all I still think the LV Meli offers better value for most players."`13.0`2020-09-16 18:05:37`35.0

If you want an easier time getting costume upgrades in the short term, they’re better, otherwise saving for units like goddess Liz, green Eastin, and zeldris are top priorities.

As a new f2p player I regret  not skipping LV. I don't  even have him  yet and I honestly don't even want him.

Why? Because when eastin or whatever the heck comes out, i definitely dont have the gems or the luck to get anything 6/6 and right now in PVP, with a 2/6 unit u're cucked out at cc (I'm talking champion 1 elites on Monday, where i contribute to the bloodbath).

You need tons of those upgrade mats to increase cosmetic stats and they go up very minimally. Hell demon takes a while to complete all in all i agree i dont think its worth it.  Too much time required and i needa start saving my gems for godess liz lol.  I managed to pull Zaneri and bought 1 cosmetic...not sure if i should even buy the other one for the guarenteed drop..got 6 gems.

Fair enough. +both banners/ anniversary and valentine units and LV meli will come back. They’re exclusive to specific dates and events. It’s not the end of the world if you don’t get them. I got both Jericho and Zaneri (in one rotation) so worst off got me I can just grind out grey demons when I can. I don’t believe they’re super op units but at the same time I do honestly love the costumes and I still got 700-800 left after buying costumes to save on other units`0.0`2020-09-16 18:11:54`35.0
You don't need to farm demons all day, having a raid partner will give you a cosmetic in about 2 days compared to other people that don't have the materials will take them a week most likely or less of they're super lucky that's a big advantage. Lost Vayne best value if you only think about high lvl pvp and high ult lvl but he isn't near as OP being 1/6 which most f2p are going to get. If banner had CS units I'd understand but only Escanor was worth in the banner`0.0`2020-09-17 05:26:12`35.0

With all due respect, if you weren’t planning to go all the way you shouldn’t have pulled on this banner in the first place. Usefulness of these units is only because of their costumes.`7.0`2020-09-16 20:28:31`35.0
The more important cosmetic is Zaneris probably.  Since you still have a 33% chance to get the proper demon.  Be nice to have the extra drop.  It just sucks that the two you got both need 2 additional cosmetics.  Elizabeth and Elaine only need one fortunately`1.0`2020-09-17 12:57:13`35.0

Around 1000~ gems when you reach chapter 8 to fully unlock level cap (that amount included clearing all free quests from 6 chapters and getting gems from achievement).

"There's always going to be meta teams. You can't balance a game like this enough to there isn't any.

That being said, non-meta teams are still very viable. Since blue pierce is still very strong, and every team runs Lillia for ult control and healing, my old faithful team of GEsca, GJeri, BKing is finally viable again!

I only play ungeared and I started with a classic Pen (bdm, bLilia, gEsca + rGria, replaced by rKing, when he came out). It was a decent team and I liked the style. A few weeks back, I decided to replace Esca with rMerlin and it's so much more fun. Sure, the Esca damage is huge and she can never compare, but it's simply fun to freeze Derieries to remove their precious buffs or freeze LV + lock bKing. It's a lot more RNG dependent but it's more fun. The advantage of the meta teams is that you know what to expect and hopefully have some idea how to handle them. Everything that is random is way more unpredictable and some Chars I have absolutely no idea what their abilities are and have to learn it the hard way ;)  (Hate the Estarossa Ult!)`3.0`2020-09-17 00:20:59`37.0

This is the EXACT same setup they did for Mono. The fact that they took Eastin out of Monos banner period (and the entire disaster event) should be proof enough that its Eastin next week.

While these units did come back for the Drole/Diane Banner on jp for the 1 year anniversary it's not guaranteed that the same would hold true. Global has been doing banners differently since launch so there is still a high possibility they can change that banner too.

"tbh, Hell shows that gKing is carried hard by Gowther + buffs that he's used to getting in Extreme. a single buffed Rank 3 Spike card will OHKO both phases of Grey, assuming a crit.

without Gowther to guarantee him Rank 3 Spike cards, and with the inability to one shot each form anyways, he just lacks steam to carry it through to the finish line consistently. and this is ignoring the increased Crit Resistance etc of the boss.

he's still good but i would take a high ult level Escanor + Merlin team rushing ults over and over with 2x GLiz over a 1/6 gKing team trying to recreate Extreme OTKs with buffs. damage without Rank 3 Spike is almost negligible."`5.0`2020-09-16 05:32:24`45.0

It's probably more effective to have the dmg boost of Gilthunder with King than to have Escanor in there as well, because he can't hit with his strongest normal card while the demon is flying.

I've seen people hit 200k+ with gilthunder's ult too so he can definatly keep up once he has his own boost on him and aside from that kings cards are gonna deal way more damage this way.

Will the costumes with the effects still be available after the event ends if I already have the character? Because if yes, i will keep summoning, if no, i have to somehow get enough gems for zaneris costume`4.0`2020-09-16 00:40:34`49.0

Yep I’m not playing anymore until there’s a guarantee SSR on summons like in Dokkan Battle.`1.0`2020-09-16 06:35:36`49.0
An example: SSR to UR headpiece costume gives 700 hp, UR to UR max only 200. If you're f2p with bunch of low quality costumes, this update is a blessing for you. You will get more CC from upgrading lower costumes than whales will get from upgrading their UR costumes.`0.0`2020-09-16 01:46:29`49.0
That the most stupid thing about all of this usualy they are avaible 2 weeks after the banner for gems. For some reason they are beginning from now avaible for 2 weeks for gems. So you have two weeks to get the unit and the skin else you fucked`1.0`2020-09-16 00:52:33`49.0
"hey, just a quick reminder that you will always somehow improve your account while playing the game, injecting money is only a very short term boost.   In real life however you can actually lose progress, being forced to sell your hard earned items because you need to something to eat. For example, the new cosmetic upgrade items can be bought in a pack of 30 each (90 total) for around 30$, while you can farm that yourself within a week (a lot faster if you trade 12 demons with a friend, even more if you accept the ~10-20 random invites a day and even more if you get the valentine units). So a player who buys this 30$ pack will only be able to increase his attack on one character by 30, def by 30 and hp by ~300-400 (not sure right now), which is absolutely neglectable in ungeared pvp and even more so in geared. The only benefit from ranking in ungeared pvp is to get more diamonds per week, it is no problem whatsoever to get to champ 5 even without escanor or lvmeli (I am 2 months in and got champ V with a mix of kingbram and random other combos, completly f2p, you get a ton of tickets to draw helbram when starting out, the 7% banner a month or so ago was insane for stuff like rgowther and green merlin, etc., maybe you even have lillia and bdmeli then this is even easier for you). After getting to champ V, the difference is 8 diamonds a week, which is one multi every 4 banners, at the current release rate. Besides, if you are f2p you are only going to max out the costumes of 4 units anyway, only to face the new broken unit in a banner they released with 800 more base cc than your character. Most of ungeared and geared pvp matches are decided by pure luck or straight up counter matchups, if you were lucky (/unlucky).
Long story short the only use case for these cosmetic upgrades is ungeared pvp and the difference is so neglectable, most matches are won by drawing lucky cards, critting (or not) and going first. 
The rich do not get richer in this game, they always have to invest more money to get more gems/upgrades/""whatever they dont want to grind"", so they actually lose money. There is no interest rate on diamonds, netmarble does not give them 2% of their banked diamonds per week or anything like that.
F2p accounts cannot go negative amounts of diamonds or materials and will not have to pay 20% of their ""income"" in materials to netmarble.

This is absolutely not comparable with real life so please stop comparing it.
Sorry for bad formatting and errors lol"`-5.0`2020-09-16 02:01:07`49.0
That what I thought as well but how do you wanna upgrade them? I believe ssr to UR costs twice as much as UR to UR max`2.0`2020-09-16 01:51:10`49.0
But it will cost you not 30 pieces`1.0`2020-09-16 02:41:14`49.0
True it's good in the long run but an SSR to UR is twice what you need to max UR . Even assuming you get 12 a day with the units that is almost a week of farming assuming you only get that one boss because you have the associated New Years Unit. Without the Valentine unit that time is doubled and that is assuming you only get the same demon for basically 2 weeks. Not impossible to get a piece per month but a bit much to do on a consistent basis`1.0`2020-09-16 04:04:41`49.0
So after the event ends there is no way for me to buy these costumes?`1.0`2020-09-16 01:23:42`49.0
Thats the point tho you cant farm them just by doing Hell demons. You have to be the party leader to get one. That why I said 6 a day. That the whole point if you could farm them as a guest  as well I would have no reason to complain. But without the costums we are forced to farm only 6 days which like I said would take 75days to max one unit without considering the events`4.0`2020-09-16 02:16:31`49.0
"The time doesn't ""doubles"". You get +1 guaranteed item per boss, yeah but by default you have a chance to get more from golden chests. It only doubles if you never get any additional items ever."`1.0`2020-09-16 04:19:45`49.0
Speaking from JP, the costumes were only available while the banner was up. After that poof`2.0`2020-09-16 03:19:34`49.0
Maybe on a returning event. The costumes disappear I’m pretty sure`1.0`2020-09-16 02:50:15`49.0
"Well it seems you did not read into it at all then, my bad for not mentioning. You have an 8% chance per dropped chest from a hell demon to get his component. Every hell demon drops 3 chests + 1 if you are party leader and +1 deathmatch-reward (always limit break material). So you have 3*8% chance to get a material per demon. 12 demons (should be your minimum) a day equals 36 8% chances to get a outfit upgrade material. 95% of all players will get at least 1 material from this, the mean will be around 2.9 materials per day (with 12 demons,  not 20+, without extra costume units). Plus your 6 guaranteed, that is 9 a day so you would actually need 60 days to fully max one unit.

So lets say you and the ""whale"" have exactly the same units, but he can get one character done in around 25 days. So when you have ""maxed"" one of your character he will have maxed 2. That is what? 150 atk 150 def 1k hp? Literally unbeatable I guess. Also, he would have to invest 64.8 million gold to max out these costumes, so he has to pay twice of your amount in the same time period.

And last but not least, the ""whale"" will have his team maxed out after 4 months, you after 8 months. If you can show me any unit that will be present and very viable for 4 months in pvp, starting today, except festival units, congrats. This is a gacha game, they'll just release better units or full counters 1-2 months later anyways. They just trick you into thinking ""one has to spend money to stay relevant"" and that is exactly how the ""rich get richer""."`1.0`2020-09-16 23:07:36`49.0
I was going only based off of the guaranteed since you can't really factor in chance drops between it but yes you do have a point in reality it would in theory be less then double assuming you'd get a bonus every day (what is the percentage, is it 8?)`0.0`2020-09-16 04:45:00`49.0
Ok, do you know if there are 10 tickets available for the banner? Because that would mean one more y11 draw for me`1.0`2020-09-16 03:28:18`49.0
"First of all bold of you to assume I would do raids just for 3× 8% chance to get cosmetic upgrades when I dont need the other meds.

Secondly if both do 12 raids a day the one with the costum would get 18+2.9(dunno how you came to the 2.9 Im just going to believe you with that) while the one without the costum would get 6+2.9 thats almost 2.5 times  more and the gap would increase the more raids per day are done.

Lasty I dont have to tell you any unit from now that will be useable in 4months since you dont get all the upgrades materials instantly. You could be doing meliodas then merlin and by then Elizabeth is out and so on 

Btw one extra Ur head piece alone gives 300 cc which is certainly not big of a difference in geared but in normal pvp where everbody is around the same cc lvl since most people already have all the Ur cosmetics for their main team then 300c can mean the zawordo."`2.0`2020-09-17 00:00:20`49.0

That’s cool. I have 39 diamonds only because I spent 2200 on the Lv Meli banner. Had I known these were coming I wouldn’t have spent 2200. Im also a $ spender. I’ve spent quite a lot since I started playing. But I am not a whale. If I feel the developers are going to put out more than I can keep up with then I quit spending or worse quit the game entirely like I did Brave Frontier. 

When games pump out units too fast it inevitably leads to people quitting. It’s dangerous. And there’s no reason for it. Why milk the cows teets until they’re bone dry when you can milk for years? Or something like that."`8.0`2020-09-15 08:37:27`50.0

What exactly makes a character good? That answer is found pretty easily. A „game“ is supposed to be an enjoyable activity.

Then I could use the logic that it’s made millions more people unhappy because they’re playing other shitty games instead of this. Neither logic holds up. If they keep pumping out units at breakneck speed they will certainly run off players. It happens in every single Gacha that goes too quick. It’s literally why Brave Frontier died and is basically on life support now with less than 10% of the players it once had. I’m not saying that’s gonna happen here. I’m just saying it’s a risk if they don’t slow the spread. Derieri to Lv Meli to Mono to these is just a bit much."`2.0`2020-09-15 08:44:30`50.0

 No the complete opposite would be the game being a raving success. It’s not even cracking into any of the top markets nor are the metrics for its social media up. You’re looking at this in terms of black and white when it’s nothing like that. You don’t have super happy customers just because they’re currently playing. That’s why no developer rests on their laurels. While one player may be happy now things add up that annoy them and they go. That’s the entire thing I’m trying to point out to you. Developers would do well to listen their player base somewhat on these issues. We can look at mountains of games with developers that didn’t and look at the state they’re in now."`2.0`2020-09-15 09:57:17`50.0

They’re kind of late game units. They’re so-so characters but their worth comes from the cosmetics bonus which, with the right costumes (the ones with the special borders) they gain you a guaranteed cosmetic upgrade drop when defeating a *hell* boss battle. As a new player you won’t be doing that right now but eventually you will, so it’s worth investing in the cosmetics to allow the bonus. But it’s a very long play for a new player.`1.0`2020-09-16 08:52:57`60.0
"The set bonuses allow you to gain extra material to upgrade cosmetics from deathmatches, the units themselfs aren't that great, you'll usually only use them as a subslot for the bonus and have 3 better units that take care of the fighting.

">So, what is the general team building  strategy for the demon fights (disaster battles), or the special event  fights?  Are these bosses susceptible to status ailments?

You usually go for color advantage first, then you look at the boss and take into account what would work well against what it does. Most bosses are immune to debuffs or remove one each turn etc, so you don't usually want to go for that, but if they are not you should definatly abuse that.

&#x200B;

>Currently,  I use R.Arthur, R.Derieri, and R.Meli for story and PVP (G.Escanor is  4th), but wondering if I need a healing unit and status unit for other  content as well.

Should be fine for story, tho i would recommend Red Gowther instead of Red Meli, cause the rank up makes RNG a lot less relevant and his general kit is really good against most enemies.

For PvP I would go with an ult rush team. Red Gowther + Blue King + R Derieri or Lostvayne Meliodas or Green Escanor with subslot Green Merlin should work pretty well. The goal is to rush ults quicky and overwhelm you enemies with a strong ult and the heavy crowd control of kings petrify and gowthers atk seal.

>Also, for the  newest banner, I see all units are new/seasonal.  I pulled the Meliodas  unit.  Is there a other notable unit to pull for?  I'm f2p, so I don't  mind stopping and waiting to pull again (I've been having for Goddess  Elizabeth).

All of them aren't used for anything but making deathmatch farming easier. 3 of them let you choose which deathmatch you'll want to fight and the other 3 allow you to gain bonus cosmetic upgrade material. You'll need to buy their special costume set tho to get this bonus because it's a set bonus for their costumes."`2.0`2020-09-16 08:58:43`60.0

Yes, one of the best uses for overnight farming. Most people only do it when there is a half stamina event which just left this weekend, next weekend will *not* be a half stamina but the weekend after will be. “Best” team is B Guila, R Howzer, R Gowther, G Merlin Sub, and you want to do Red Books, this team can clear the stage in around 1 minute taking 3-4 turns.

"I'm a returning player, so this mechanic is also new to me. If you don't mind my simple analysis:

blue Jenna is the more worthwhile one because the bonus material she is associated with enhances Headpieces which in turn boosts HP-related stats. Between ATK/DEF/HP, HP contributes the most towards CC. The boost in HP and CC is always useful in PvP.

green Zaneri: enhances Outfits/Armor (DEF-related)

red Elaine: enhances Weapons (ATK-related)

Also, if you don't me saying, since you pulled the characters you should try to get the bonus cosmetics else it's kinda a waste going into the banner in the first place, unless you just wanna collect them and wait for possible cosmetic reruns. Meliodas/Jericho/Liz, not required if you ask me.

Needs to be Green Merlin, not only is her kit really good with the shield and the ult gauge removal, but her passive is a must have for ult rush. It gives all your units +1 ult gauge at the start of battle, this means if you start second cause your opponen uses CC food you can get 3 ult gauge orbs on all units if you use ult gauge food. 

You're usually able to get two ult's ready by the second turn with this, Just combine the card that you pulled two of and use 2 cards with another unit. Unless your opponent can remove ult gauge they are pretty much dead."`1.0`2020-09-17 01:33:44`60.0

"I would advise you to save up your diamonds after you've got the cosmetics. 

It would be fine to do the first two steps of the mono banner since its 31 diamonds for 22 units. After that I would say to stop since mono has a rate up and even though she is my absolute waifu it hurts me to say that she is not really good. Valenti is really good for grey demon but it would be enough if your partner has one since the passives don't stack and only the more resistant valenti gets to apply her passive. Blilia is really good for farming but you can do just fine without her as well. you'll get the OC units eventually and right now and up until green eastin is released none of them will be 'must pulls' either.

If you're close to the 900 mark for lvmeli you can pull but honestly 3/6 is more than enough to make it to champ in ungeared. 

Eastin again is a win more unit like valenti and blilia. It makes life easier but you can handle stuff just fine without them.

Reason being why you should conserve your diamonds especially if you don't want to spend money is because of the next festival unit - goddess elizabeth. She single handedly killed single target ults in pvp and is an absolute god tier supporting unit since not only does she revive the first dying unit once, she has a shield that nullifies any damage multiplies like amplify (except the one where it does more damage against buffs), her ult is a massive heal that reflects damage taken for a few turns after.

If you don't care too much for goddess liz though you can ignore all of the above and just pull where your heart tells you to pull since you have the right to enjoy the game the way you want to enjoy it"`2.0`2020-09-16 12:16:45`60.0

In that case, I would first get Elaine's cosmetic, since you only need to buy one piece (the headpiece, for 30 gems, since she has no weapons). Then buy Jenna's if you can get enough gems, which will be another 60 gems. You should be able to get enough gems just from the daily rewards for these.`1.0`2020-09-16 18:19:29`60.0

It really depends on the unit but general rule of thumb is HP/DF for supports/utility/associations and ATK/DF for DPS units. There are exemptions like ATK/DF over HP/DF for Valenti if you only use her for raids and HP/DEF over ATK/DEF on Merlin if you only use yer for her passive`2.0`2020-09-14 13:26:41`67.0
So I’m recently getting back into it myself but as you probably know, the 2,000,000 means 2 million account combat class. The  heart and shield refer to health and defense gear sets which raise combat class the most`1.0`2020-09-14 17:35:51`67.0
yeah you can easily do it without throwing fodder gear on all your characters`2.0`2020-09-14 15:22:11`67.0

You my friend, are smart.`6.0`2020-09-15 19:20:06`68.0
Depends on how you look at it. Are you going to buy the unit from the CS? If so that’s 10 plat coins. Let’s say you are extremely lucky and can pull 1 SSR per 2 multis in any other banner. That’s 60 diamond X 10 = 600, and that’s on the lucky end. So if you’re someone looking for dupes or has gems right now then on average it make sense to pull on the rate up banner. The strategy is more for dolphins/whales but it’s still cheaper for them in the long run to pull on the banner and use plat coins for dupes from the coin shop.`1.0`2020-09-17 10:00:35`68.0

"5 weeks with the guaranteed weekly ticket, or 7 weeks with the guaranteed weekly ticket at worst, 0 diamonds spent getting those.

If you add diamonds to the equation, it's a fraction of what you are suggesting, considering you have to wait quite a while before the unit is actually buyable (2 weeks from the banner + 2 weeks after that). You will be sitting with MINIMUM 4 plat coins with 0 diamonds spent when the unit is fresh from the shop.

&#x200B;

Using your 1 SSR per 2 multis, it is 3\*60 = 180 gems (on a banner that you are actually interested) to get a 7 plat coin shop unit, if you are willing to wait.

Not to mention that during that month Netmarble usually has an event going on that gives 1-2 SSR part 1 tickets, making it even more manageable.

A player can still earn mats on the raid without these characters but its more grindy. This is the life in gachas. You get everything slower for more work or you spend money to get things faster.`18.0`2020-09-15 05:07:58`69.0

I honestly don’t understand why LV was such a high priority investment move for f2p players. Yeah he’s a sick unit but there’s SO many ways to beat him atm in pvp. Don’t see it being worth 900 gems as a f2p. Not even worth it myself as a goldfish/dolphin player.`5.0`2020-09-15 05:22:45`69.0
Honestly, pulling even just 1-2 of those units can drastically decrease the cosmetics grind though. However, upgrading cosmetics is very endgame so unless you’re there, I don’t find it wise to pull. As a low spender, I may personally do a full rotation, depending on the banner.`2.0`2020-09-15 07:36:16`69.0

I wasn't even happy that I got him, I have completely accepted my fate of getting shafted that I was disappointed that I was wrong about getting shafted. Maybe next time I'll look at this post again when I've lost all hope and accept my fate once again so I can be wrong and receive another great hero."`1.0`2020-09-14 21:01:03`71.0

You should definitely save. There’s no point in going for dupes right now because if it’s like Jp the Goddess banner will have better rates and probably better characters. Having gems for Goddess Liz is more important than Lv dupes right now cause of how good she is and how much better she makes Lv teams and any team in general at least in my opinion.`14.0`2020-09-14 06:11:20`71.0
I pulled an extra copy of LV on my first rotation, so im going for the 3/6 and im almost there because of how much i saved, but I would bank on not getting an extra copy to get to 3/6 expect to just get to 2/6 if you did a second rotation. I say save honestly LV comes back and the banner will be better`6.0`2020-09-14 05:57:51`71.0
Save. I got lucky on my first rotation and I got LV to 3/6. I thought I'd get at least 5/6 on my second rotation, but I only pulled the guaranteed copy and got LV to 4/6. It depends on how lucky you think you are, but imo, you should save. You'll get more copies during the anni, especially if you start saving now and skip every other banner. Except for zeldris.`1.0`2020-09-14 09:27:36`71.0

Red is the weakest of them. In crimson you can take gowther ( best support ) and derieri ( best dps ) which make it the easiest. Grey limits your options on who you can take cuz only ranged attacks affect him unless he is on ground. Yes valenty is the best option for grey but you won't patience his attacks or come even close to patiencing, but you will take less dmg that's true.`-5.0`2020-09-15 03:40:07`72.0

There's a difference. In fgo every single unit can be used, even the lower rarity servants (Arash probably being the most used). It's a story driven game. Not meta focused. Sure the drop rates are utter garbage and you can go for ages without pulling the unit you want, but atleast the fillers are usable for content. In a game where meta changes constantly in PvP if you want to be competitive, you need the latest meta units or atleast units that can compete. There's nothing wrong with wanting to catch up. But when a game puts a featured unit at the same rate as the filler, and at least 80% of said filler is just utter garbage that cannot be used in PvP or PvE that's a shit move. The other difference is on FGO we know when the next unit is coming. We get the welfares at Np5. They don't change up the release schedule to milk players(the normal banners do that already). They don't release 6 exclusive units that were originally released at two different times needing cosmetics which you have to buy with premium currency in one go right after the most hyped release to date. That's what people are mad about.`4.0`2020-09-14 22:53:35`74.0

This is simply an answer to this statement.

You are acting like this is the worst gacha ever when in reality most of the gachas are not f2p ( what makes sense, since the companies obviously want to make money ) 

You get a good game that is free with constant updates and no one forces u to keep up with the highest 10% pvp players in the world.

It’s not worth it in the end to spend in a mobile game (unless u have the spare money) Youtuber obviously get the money back they used so its very smart but for normal consumers who think they have to do the same it’s very dumb. There are a lot of Yt box reviews where they tell u exactly this.

I am not the guy you were responding to but I would like to ask you a question if you don't mind, in my experience playing the game completely F2P I was able to clear all story chapters, reach champion in both geared and ungeared, clear 75 stars reverse stages and achieve high score in guild boss and If I don't care about the metas then I get 90 gems or 3 multis a week and 7 more singles from ads+ ssr ticket every week. in my opinion that make the game top notch F2P friendly game. but you and others seem to disagree so may I know why do you think the game is not f2p friendly?"`-2.0`2020-09-14 23:16:25`74.0

They aren't made for raids as they're weak for those raids. All existing units are way better. Their costumes sets, on other hand, for which you have to pay additional diamonds to get, are helping to speed up farming some mats. And at this point you decide if it worth it or not.

"Okay, champ ungeared literally over half the playerbase is in, you do realize that right? You can’t get demoted, making the lower tiers the easiest climb imaginable over time. If you are a champ 1 player easy, if you go to champ 5 from taking a break for example, you will steamroll every single person you find or they’ll forfeit instantly. This I wouldn’t consider pvp success as a f2p. I got there in the third week of the game without spending money you’re not special. Now let’s go to champ 2 and 1, you’ll still be able to win games against other people even paying players as a f2p who has played for awhile. When you get to a whale though, you will be 10k cc below them and probably get ult rushed or 1 unit wiped first turn in this current meta. 

Back to pvp in a bit, but the  pve is a complete joke, so that’s why new players have an illusion of thinking the game is f2p friendly. The pve though is not meant to ever be a challenge, it’s to build you up for pvp. Pvp is majority of this games endgame content. Global hasn’t even had any pve that you can be considered hard with an endgame account, because all endgame pve we have right now is just to help improve your account. 

We have guild boss, and deathmatches with the occasional fb. Guild boss and non-hell deathmatches are made to give you demon parts for awakenings, anvils gold and pendants. They are not meant to be the main challenge of the game. Hell bosses overtime become a complete joke too btw, the main challenge is always pvp. 

The story mode is incredibly easy aswell, with a few roadblocks, because it’s to get players accustomed to the game and show them the story of 7ds, again not endgame. A good mobile game is always able to make it players feel like it’s f2p but still always have that p2w factor to make money. Grand cross does a great job of this clearly lol. when you start to do what the game encourages you, pvp, even when you have success (again champ is not an accomplishment especially you’re a launch player) you’ll have games where you obviously were severely disadvantaged because you either got less lucky with pulling dupes, or didn’t spend enough in costumes. Gear you can thankfully grind as a f2p at a reasonable rate, but still, go look at the top cc players. You will never have a chance against even the lower tier whales let alone accounts like Seatin. 

Now all the top tier levels of content, top 100 geared and final boss, you will never achieve. This is where the serious competition is, and your disadvantage from being f2p will be so much more apparent. I don’t expect f2p to reach top 100 in any gacha though and neither should you, I’m just pointing out how much of an advantage spending money gives you, **aka the literal definition of pay to win**.

agree champion 5 is not super hard to get wither you are f2p or p2p, that doesn't make it an argument for either side. about whales having more cc, that make sense for the most part unless you are running good investment f2p units.

you keep repeating PvE is made for PvP but that doesn't check out, there are players who play PvE only, there are challenges in PvE like reverse stages that barely benefit PvP at all, you will do me a great favour if you separate your own personal opinions from actual facts.

spamandrice is a challenger f2p player streamer who wins against normal whales even if he loses to massive whales like seatin. just to make my point clear, I am not saying f2p beat whales consistently nor am I saying you don't win more the more you pay. just to get my point across I believe the game is both f2p friendly because you can do everything and find good sucess as f2p AND it is p2w because no shit whales win more than f2p and that's fine, doesn't make it anti-f2p

**out of all whales only a 100 reach top 100 (no shit), does that make the game anti whales because the vast majority of whales will never be top 100?? no it doesn't and it doesn't make it anti-f2p as well. top 100 means nothing beside a title, you need a better argument than than to convince me.**

Again, this is coming from someone who doesn't really understand the game from f2ps eyes. You said at least 210 gems per character, but the likes of Merlin require us to spend around 60 or so to have full ssr- ur cosmetics. You say guild boss isn't the challenge of the game.... But it is? I am in top 30 knighthood and we love being competitive on guild boss, with each other and with other knighthoods, so yes I most definitely consider that end game content that is very fun. You say pvp is really hard and you can't compete and stuff, but you don't realize that most of the player base is f2p, so even if I lose games to hard whales I will have more than good fun against other f2p players. Hell demons are doable by everyone, hell, the game even gives us a copy of nunchuck ban, g king and Slater so everyone can have a very good dps unit for each. Gowther, the best support unit in game is give for free to any new and returning players. I have landed in top 0% on 2 final bosses with my f2p account, so I'm pretty sure the likes of f2p players like spamandrice can land in top 100 if they try hard enough. The biggest difference between my f2p and my p2w accounts is my box. The undeniable difference is that p2w can build all the units really easily while f2p take much much more time tryna grind everything.

Meanwhile, f2p can buy cheap cosmetics, like sr/ssr or already have them since many characters have ssr cosmetics by default or from affinity. Single SSR cosmetics boosted to UR gives 700 hp.

Spam, a challenger player, still consistently loses to whales like Seatin who you even brought up. Is that enough of an indicator that there’s clear p2w aspects?

The one saving grace to your argument was your comment about reverse stages, non-repeatable content that is an rng fest and pretty much you waiting to slowly grind up your roster. I personally do not consider that a challenge. Again, success against other f2p or content not meant to be a challenge doesn’t magically negate the scaling ult levels, the stats on costumes, the ability to instantly gain thousands of cc on gear with money, because everytime you face someone who does this significantly, you’re disadvantaged. They’ve spent money to help them win, aka paying to win. 

When you go into champ and challenger majority of your wins are against other f2p players, because there’s so many that challenger isn’t a significant barrier. Ungeared have already mentioned is even easier because you can’t get demoted.

The rate that units get powercreeped is faster than the rate at which a f2p can max out a unit. By the team you max your f2p team, the meta will be flippped on it’s head and you probably won’t be able to use the exact team you build with much success."`1.0`2020-09-15 02:19:39`74.0

Like I said to the other guy though we will never agree because we have different philosophies for what makes a game f2p friendly. You think because you can beat f2p and do easy pve content that means the entire game is f2p friendly, and I disagree"`0.0`2020-09-15 01:45:48`74.0
And once again, you will build up your main team cosmetics pretty fast, while whales will do it for all units to build box cc, f2p won't need them on all characters. So whales need valentines units more than f2p if anything.`1.0`2020-09-15 01:44:27`74.0
You do know there are teams other than festival unit teams? F2P coin shop Zeldris for example, whose ult lvl doesn't matter than much cuz if he crits he kills anyone and anything is counter to festival king, pair him up with drole and he counters ult rush teams too pretty nicely. F2P can think of such teams and save for them instead of festival units also. Also stop spreading your comments into a bunch of short ones in hope I'll miss something and you can actually win this argument like that, write it all at once ffs.`0.0`2020-09-15 01:49:40`74.0
The meta changes though. By the time you max the f2p team it will be irrelevant in the meta, and you’ll have to start building newer units`1.0`2020-09-15 01:46:45`74.0
Whales can max the newest meta teams regardless, making your months of hard work irrelevant against them. Again, showing a clear advantage from spending.`1.0`2020-09-15 01:47:21`74.0
You do realize that you can buy the costume upgrade materials too right? The game gets more and more blatantly p2w as time goes on.`1.0`2020-09-15 01:50:26`74.0
You also will need at least 200 gems each to get their UR cosmetics. Then make their UR gear. Then level their costumes. Or you can spend money and accelerate all of those things.`1.0`2020-09-15 01:53:24`74.0
I’m just going to drop this here though there’s no reason to continue the argument. We never will agree and if you really still are trying to ignore all the p2w aspects of this game I pity you. You’ll realize one day how ignorant you were and how blatantly p2w the game is.`1.0`2020-09-15 01:54:33`74.0
"Zeldris you will need 42 coins to get him 6/6. He isn’t reliant on ult but just saying. You would also need to wait weeks to get him on discount that many times. 

Drole is a banner unit, there’s no guarantee you will ever get him. Festival units are the best option for f2p to invest in because their banners have high value and have a guaranteed at 900. 

You could spend 2000 gems on drole banner and get jack shit"`0.0`2020-09-15 01:52:16`74.0
That's funny coming from p2w to f2p. I know how this game works for me as f2p, you only knows how it works when you spend money and you are telling me it sux for me? You are a weird one for sure`0.0`2020-09-15 01:57:12`74.0
"And then drole goes into ticket summons too, and both of them will be on 7% commandement banner. So f2p can either 
1) according to you just summon on festival banners and end up with like 1/6 fest unit, and you alone said eli is super reliant on ult lvl
Or 
2) build teams from heroes you can get easily from many different sources and level their ults much much easier"`0.0`2020-09-15 01:55:39`74.0
Again for the 19th time, no matter how good you are as a f2p, you will get clapped by spenders that have committed the similar amount of time as you and also, you could always be significantly better if you just spent money.`1.0`2020-09-15 02:54:12`74.0
I still don’t have green meli, even using every part 1 ticket and free ad summon since launch. Why do you assume that putting them in ticket banners makes him guaranteed?`1.0`2020-09-15 02:53:09`74.0
Even focusing on one specific team though, it doesn’t matter because again, the meta changes faster than the rate at which you can build teams. Do you understand yet?`1.0`2020-09-15 02:55:14`74.0
"Slowly building up fest banners as a f2p is your best option if you plan on not relying on rng. Guess what too, fest king makes one of the best coin shop units, blue king, completely irrelevant. 

These units aren’t going to last forever, and we’ve already established even easily accessible units get powercreeped. So coin shop units aren’t the ultimate solution like you think, and all banner units that aren’t fest units should be a skip because of how low overall value their banners are, unless you like Deldry dupes. 

Again, even zeldris a cs unit will take 40+ coins and weeks of waiting for him to rotate into the disclunt section. By the time a f2p 6/6’s him why do you assume he’ll still be remotely relevant?"`1.0`2020-09-15 02:58:34`74.0

"Even at 1/6, he's still pretty dang good despite all the naysayers, it's just more important to keep his cards in hand to boost the ultimate. I was able to hold a steady 80% winrate with him at 2/6. This has been my favorite comp to play so far by a long shot, but it's not all about LVM, Gowther and King really hold their own in this comp, Gowther's attack seal can completely shut down some teams and his ult allows you to beat other ult rush teams if you focus on him, bKing's ult can completely destroy front lines and his petrify can be whats needed to stall a turn for LVM to get ready or to hold off an ult gauge rollback.

Only hard counters I've had much issue with are blue pierce, because BDM destroys LVM, and mono red (ONLY when they go first and get a lvl 3 Arthur buff first turn, otherwise I think the matchup favors LVM due to bKing).

If you're eating Ult food, you can get his ult ready for turn 2 with only moving cards and not having to play anything. His attack skills don't do a ton of damage at rank 1, so it's important to keep them in hand hoping for a crit and to also boost the ult. Moving the cards ensures that you have his ultimate with at least 2 cards in hand and that should be enough to wipe out or severely cripple most front lines, even at 1/6 or 2/6.

now for the ticket, the ticket guarantee you an SSR, we may expect a single SSR in roughly 90 gems so even at its worst the SSR ticket is better value, assuming you get one of the best 4 units in the pool you will get way more value than 60 gems."`2.0`2020-09-15 02:26:07`76.0

no problem, the leader is guaranteed 1 drop, and then you have a chance to get drops whether you are the leader or not. then sweet temptation units gurantee another 1 drop whether you are the leader or not. so if you are the leader with cosmetics you get 2+ drops per run. if you are guest with cosmetics you get minimum 1+ per run.`1.0`2020-09-16 04:01:27`76.0

A sr coin gives 15 points and the first and second stage takes 225 so 15 sr coins each for both the first star and second star. For the third star it costs 450 so it would cost 30 sr coins. The final star is 675 which costs 45 sr coins. So In total it would cost 105 sr coins to fully max one unit.`21.0`2020-09-14 16:03:20`77.0

"SR and SSR substats can only be rerolled with diamonds or anvils. Since SSR gear gives more stats you might as well go straight into upgrading SSR.

SR is generally viewed as a waste of resources.

To engrave gear, you need these purple stones which are hard to come by and are generally very limited... engraving gives a certain stat bonus based on the item's base stat total.

This person not only wasted materials upgrading SR gear, but he wasted purple stones committing to them.

There are quests that give you a guaranteed piece of gear every 8 runs you do, and you can choose which set you want to farm and u can repeat this as much as you want.

I’m sure mono red w/ R Derieri would work, but you need godly RNG to get A) Slater debuff, B) Gowther debuff consistently, while also getting Gowther’s ult fast enough to stop him from ulting (so by turn 3). Otherwise, the boss will strip buffs from the party/Derieri, nevermind the damage rolling out.

If you ever want to come back but dont want to get addicted, I was the same as you logging in early everyday to get an early start playing grinding until I decided that why should I care about being better then others? So i just started to play the game at my own pace just enjoying the gameplay and characters and taking the time to appreciate the work put in to it. So my recommendation is just to play at your own pace at a different mindset that would allow you to be productive and enjoy the game`33.0`2020-09-13 17:17:18`82.0
"Stings, doesn't it? 

As I see it, the game kind of became your short-lived partner. You love it and devoted so much time into it, but you know it's time to let go or you'll crash and burn.

Good luck to you, I also have a friend in a completely parallel situation. He was a megalodon too, prepping for 6/6 LV. He actually quit three weeks prior to LV's release because he foresaw the disastrous future if he had continued."`24.0`2020-09-13 17:13:52`82.0
"I’m in the same spot but I can’t just uninstall the game, I spent a lot in this game like 300 or more, for me is a lot, in from mexico, but I just can’t leave it.

"I would recommend actually playing the game for fun. It seems that it became a toxic experience for you, I do dailies because it’s something to do, and there’s nothing wrong with playing every day for a few minutes like log in check in and leave, and play more than a few minutes on your free days, it’s a mobile game after all being available on your phone makes it extremely easy to access

Everything is bad in huge amount (even water) 

I would just play every few often, check new stuff, play pvp once in a while, just don’t spend a large part of your life on it, it’s not that hard, trust me.

Despite all this, if you still quit for good, I wish you good luck, but an addiction can happen with anything, farewell"`11.0`2020-09-13 18:49:16`82.0

It’s hard not to get addicted. Thanks for making me realize I might be doing a little too much of the unnecessary which is affecting my life as well. I stay up until reset as well when there’s literally no good reason to.

"every game you download or play on your phone, will require daily's, money, and Time, doesn't even have to be a gacha that's the way they make money, getting people hooked up

so i would say, it will be the exact same thing if u install a new game maybe tomorrow after playing it few months , because to be honest, it's just something to keep yourself busy but it should not control your life that is on you :)

every mobile game is repetive but i will hang on this one untill diablo comes and hope for the best, for a new style of mobile game, but its unlikely :("`4.0`2020-09-13 20:12:35`82.0

I am not addicted but my brother is. I started playing 2 months ago or so. I told my brother that this game is really great and that he should install it too. He did and didn't play it much at the beginning. I was of course better than him because I played the game earlier than him. But after a few days I noticed he was already getting better than me. After 2 weeks he was already better than me. That's kinda normal but he started playing it more often that I couldn't keep up with him. I always keep telling him to stop or that he's addicted to the game but he just denies it. Idk what to do at this point`3.0`2020-09-13 21:35:19`82.0

While there is an initial period where you can find things to do for hours on end, the game quickly boils down to 1h/day cycle. And you don’t have to do even that in 1 burst, you can spread that throughout the day as you please.`2.0`2020-09-13 20:01:30`82.0
Since you've uninstalled you could reinstall to get the account transfer information and either give it away or sell it. Entirely up to you I'm sure someone wouldn't mind a head start in the game. It might help you completely stop playing the game if that's what you want`2.0`2020-09-13 20:38:46`82.0

"I think it’s because the state of the game which is quite competitive between players so you start to become competitive as well. I agree that this game is very addictive, because I don’t stick to a game more than 3 months but this one I’ve been sticking since the beginning and I still have fun.

Only because I know it’s a game and I’m just a casual player, I play it when I have time. It takes me an hour everyday to do the dailies and once that is done, I don’t log back in there till the next day. If I’m grinding, I put it on my other phone and do something else.

I only pay attention to the game when there’s a big event, but even so, I would do that for a few days, till I clear the exchange store then come back to my normal routine. I don’t feel the need to compete with anyone. I play it at my own pace.

Hope if you ever decide to come back. You can do the same. Just enjoy the game at your own way."`2.0`2020-09-13 23:48:12`82.0

"The game works on rewarding addiction loops. Its designed around getting you hooked and wanting to keep playing. On a broader scope though addictive behaviour is something you can't just switch off or get rid of by going cold turkey. The only way to counter it is by being mindful of the addictive thoughts as they happen and then let those thoughts subside naturally and calmly without following the white rabbit down the hole. Much easier said than done though if you have an addictive personality.

PVP - No matter how high ur gear, u will lose. Ungear also the same crap  
Banners - Not only shafting your wallet but your emotions  
Heroes - So obvious the latest meta heroes is playable the rest is just collectible  


I have been complaining to NERFmarble over my Google Play review (forever 1 star rating) that PVP is so unbalance and nerve wrecking and they will not bother except finding ways to make more money

Then looking at all this future update (in reference to JP server) its no longer worth grinding in this game, not worth collecting knowing that you need to be a super whale in order to win PVP and my personal opinion, the system are design to piss you off when match making in PVP.

With all this changes in Hell Death Match, Enhance Gear and the upcoming crazy anticipation of Eliz God banner. I SERIOUSLY give up... No fun anymore and sick of it. No longer rewarding to play no matter how beautiful your waifu character perform. 

Anyway, this is my first and last post here. I'm quitting this game for good and not gonna install anymore NERFmarble games. Cause it makes me realized it will end up in absolute disappointment even with full geared, full hero ulti or even getting LV Meli, God Eliz, god like Escanor.

I really love this game too, but I only play like 1 hour a day and at most 2 hours, because most of my grind is like a 75 time repeat and other stuff I just use an auto ticket, like boss battles, so that's little stress. Also, I rarely summon too, because I dodge all the rip off banners. However, I'm addicted into health and working out too much to login EVERY single day, but my PvP CC is still like about 155,000+, so  I'm pretty okay.

I'm also a college student in my last semester so I'm starting to get busy with certain things. I really hope I stop playing gacha games altogether with this, I've been playing this kind of game since I am in high school and I just realized that I keep craving for gacha games meaning I actually have a gambling problem, and that's really not good for me. The fact that I can spend $55 and $78.88 on Crossing Void just 2 months before I play 7DS makes me wonder how much money will I spend if I already have a stable income.

>The game is very fun, but lately I felt like I was completing the dailies just to not lose the gems, and it feels more like a job than fun. 

This part is so relatable, it doesn't feel fun anymore. I always keep in my mind that games are supposed to relieve you from stress, but I didn't realize until just recently that this game gave me stress instead. 

In PVP, ever since pierce meta is a thing, it's always the same team and I'm already kind of bored of it but at least some people are still using different teams, but now that LV is here, it's even worse. Not once did I not face a team with him in it.

The hardest part is, like any other games, saying goodbye to my guildmates. I came back like 2 or 3 times before I actually quit it 2 days ago just so I can talk with them, after saying my final words and even that started with ""if I suddenly disappeared"" because I just can't really say goodbye properly, it's really hard for me.

I offer you a challenge. Not to quit! You’ve already identified the problem. The amount of time you’re investing does not benefit your current lifestyle. So rework the equation modify the amount of time invested in the game so that it fits your lifestyle and improve yourself with a life lesson in self-control. If you enjoy something enough it’s worth fighting for and if it’s so easy to give up so maybe you really didn’t enjoy it as much as you thought in the first place.

Unfortunately the current gacha model is too profitable for the devs to want to change it. Hell some AAA, full priced games have tried adding some aspects of gachas to their titles. All gachas are are pocket slot machines with a popular IP skin, everything about them is designed to suck you in and direct you to the gacha. Thats why we need to go to the shop each day for our freebies, why even free events have elements of rng like the current bingo event, and even the little summoning cues you get when you pull (monsters eyes lighting up, hawk being present etc) are to get your brain to start pumping out all sorts of chemicals like dopamine and other 'feel good' chems the body naturally produces. Just being aware of this goes a long way in stopping the game from becoming an addiction but even then it can still get its hooks into even the most aware individuals.`2.0`2020-09-14 01:45:56`82.0

"That's the problem with addiction. The self control is an ever increasing delusion. Alcoholics don't have one taste of beer and then immediately drink themselves into Oblivion. They think they are controlling it right up until the point where something makes them realize they aren't. 

Mobile/gacha games are the worst for this because hey, it's just a game right? We all played games as a kid. There are no side effects to having fun, right? But they bake addictive reward loops into an otherwise fun activity.

Take daily rewards for example. There's a reason you get that sweet reward at the end of the week or month. It's because it's forming a habit in your brain.

"Honestly sometimes i feel im teetering on the edge of a hobby and video game addiction myself. Usually when i feel im spending too much time staring at at pixels on my phone i take 4 days to a week and only open the game 1x each day just to keep the login streak. I dont use 1 energy, do any summons or even play around with my roster, just 2 secs to login, have liz drop some gifts on me then logout. I dont even visit the reddit sub because it know itll just create fomo for me.

However sometimes its best just to walk away if it gets too bad and theres nothing wrong with admitting you my have an issue. Gachas are designed to hook people into playing everyday and every move the devs make are to both get more money from players and to get people to stay ingame longer. Its good you recognized this before it affected your life to the point where something hordenous happens (you lose your job, break up with gf or spouse or basically bankrupt yourself chasing animated images).

This may seem a little extreme for a mobile game but if you do decide to pick 7ds up again try sceheduling your time in game. Set an amount of time per day or whatever and once that times up dont touch the game again until the next day. If you start finding it too difficult to stick to the schedule then you have to quit for good.

If it has great rates, or even just has nothing but the new guys as SSR, people would likely be a lot more willing to ""forgive"" this one (I hope no one's actually as entitled as to actually feel like that tho lol)


If it's the usual shtick with a laughable amount of just...shit characters that make up most of the SSR pool I can see why someone would be frustrated by it."`6.0`2020-09-15 16:59:08`84.0

After 960 gems just to get 1 red king (about $300 spent on gems)  
and 450 on derieri banner to get NO DERIERI (Another $150)  
Seeing people get these units on their first few multis made me stop spending.   


I understand gacha's a game of luck. I'm good at poker, i win money most of the time, but holy hell, my luck in SDSGC is nothing short of shit. They can run any god units for all i care, because i ain't getting them. LOL

When you beat a Boss Battle, you have a % chance of triggering a Death Match against a Demon, as you progress through the story you will unlock 3 demons to fight (Red, Grey and Howlex in that order, Red being the easiest and Howlex the hardest)  
Every time you beat a Boss Battle and don't trigger a Death Match, the % to trigger one increases for the next time you beat that particular Boss Battle, this happens until you trigger a Death Match.

You can only do 1 Death Match per Town per day, meaning at most you can trigger 6 Death Matches of your own. But you can join as many PUG's as you want.

The Demon you get is randomly selected based which demos you have unlocked.

The New Year units ""New Legend"" Demon Meliodas, Elizabeth and Jericho have a costume set that has the effect of triggering a specific demon when using them (with the costume set) on boss fights.

Death Matches can drop Demon Mats, which are used to limit break units (Increase their level cap by 5 levels)

"Your #1 priority should be to get champion 5 in ungeared pvp if you haven't. You can do that with arthur/gowther/red escanor, or blue king/blue diane/anyone/green merlin sub; you don't need to spend gems.                  


Other reasons not to spend: the current festival banner is a lot worse than the next one we'll get, lostvayne isn't required for anything, and he's pretty weak if you just get 1 copy of him.                 



We're going to get banners with a 7% chance to summon an SSR, with a cap of 10 summons each. The banners will feature only sins or only commandments, including coinshop units. These are the absolute best banners for F2P if you haven't maxed coinshop units yet.

Don’t pull for LV meli until the goddess Liz banner pulls up. This is critical to your ssr gains in the long run. The rates will be up, and you can choose between goddess Liz and LV meli at 900.

The fact is he hits like a wet noodle with 1/6 ultimate level with full cosmetics (first hand experience) in PvP. Less u have him at 4/6 ultimate levels, LV Meli is very underwhelming.

I probably am going to hang tight for some of the step up for the characters I really like. I think the hype was kinda making me wonder if it was the wrong choice, but my real interest in in building a diverse account so that I can go through the storyline more easily, not in getting characters who will only help with PVP matches.`3.0`2020-09-14 14:27:01`87.0

Damn good choice. I grinded my ass off to get the guarantee for lv meli but I don’t play PvP and the only other uses of lv meli are some tower of trials stages (but Estarossa will be better usually) and farming (but I have a full pierce team already).

Thank you! I'm super excited for gloxinia. Ive heard that he's not gonna be like the best character out there, but he's one of my favorites from the show. I pulled for mono, because it was an 11 character pull for only 1 diamond at step 2, and wound up actually getting her step one, and a slater dupe on step 2. Pretty solid imho.`2.0`2020-09-14 15:09:57`87.0
"Yeah it's tough. You don't have to do it this way, but once you decide on a team, you should try to buy every cosmetic for those 4 characters and get them all to lv 80 6* (with 6/6 lv 80 6* supports), which if you're f2p is gonna be slow. I've been f2p since launch and I finally hit champ 5 this week. I missed a lot of banners buying cosmetics or SSR coins instead of pulling. Even with all that, there's still so much rng involved. I ran the meta LV Meli rush towards the end, but if you swap bKing w rArthur you'll have a team that consistently beat me when they got Arthur's lv 3 buff in the first 2 turns. Eventually I found certain times of day where I was more likely to face bots and would try to do most of my runs then.

I say all that not to discourage you but just to let you decide before you go all in if it's worth it for an extra 20 or 30 gems per week."`5.0`2020-09-14 14:12:59`87.0
For gems.  Once you reach a certain bracket you never get demoted so reaching champion should be everyone's goal. After that you only need to do 1 (or 3 during event) a day, win or lose doesn't matter get your daily rewards gem.`1.0`2020-09-15 02:34:25`87.0

I appreciate that. I have my 4 mains for PVP all at 80 and 6*, and have been working pretty tirelessly on costumes, as well as equipment (for the storyline more than pvp). Im not exactly f2p, i buy the hawk pass and some of the weekly diamond reward things sometimes, but I'm certainly not the type of player who spends a ton of money either. I really appreciate you laying this out for me. I really never have played video games. My boyfriend and roommate talked me into this one because I loved the show. My roommate found out last week that I didn't have any equipment on anyone, and had to step by step explain it all to me. Said he was astonished I had made it as far as I had though, so there's that.

"Well I am confused. Why is this Babben considered head mod now? From what I see he doesn’t even have full permissions and is the newest. I don’t like this direction at all. If all the work is left to Waethrman that just isn’t a good thing. He can only do so much. Do note that I’m not chastising you for stepping down Ben. I’ve done the same thing in the past when I couldn’t get along with another mod.  

Honestly I think if that Babben guy is going to be the problem then he should go or another sub could be formed. I don’t know if you guys considered that or not. as a guy who’s been a moderator on some extremely large subs I know how annoying these issues are. One problematic moderator can fuck it up for the entire team. But I hope this can be worked out.

"This came up in a conversation about a month ago from when the last mod team (myself included) fell apart.

As I said then, I don't have any desire to run or mod a sub, especially a new one, as it takes too much work to run an existing one - let alone start a fresh one.

The only reason I signed back on here is because I was assured I'd have the support I needed to do my PSAs and FAQs, which is all I was ever interested in doing.

Watching Waethrman trying to moderate and make changes with zero input from the rest of the team bummed me out, so that's when I got more involved in the moderation side. From that point it was just the pair of us in the Reddit Staff chat pushing out new ideas and changes to help make things better.

I think between the pair of us we've put together a really solid base over the past month, and the sub is in the best position it's ever been. I just hope that he gets the support he needs now to maintain it and help it improve further (e.g we've barely scratched the work that needs to be done on the wiki)."`8.0`2020-09-13 13:02:09`88.0

There's nothing wrong with hp/defense. What you want depends on what you're going to use the unit for. PvE generally wants attack/defense, PvP can go either way.

Buddy you fucked up. Hp equipment has a heart, recovery equipment has a plus sign and is considered to be the worst in the game.  Also if you have escanor the best equips for him is attack and defense. Attack has a sword icon and defense has a shield icon`17.0`2020-09-13 03:20:32`91.0

"Nothing wrong at all because you will eventually also need a HP/DEF set for other characters and you can always switch equipment around. But people usually go with ATK/DEF sets for Escanor the substats should be ATK% on the top set Bracer and Ring, DEF% on the middle set Necklace and Earring and HP% on the bottom set Belt and Orb. 

Of course you can just swap the set over to Blue King when you get him as he is one of the best units in the game and the HP/DEF set is perfect for him focusing on ATK/DEF/HP%"`2.0`2020-09-13 06:59:57`91.0

HP/def is not bad ans one of 2 possible good choices. However, if you look at the image, you can see that this guy doesn't have ANY set and a really bad choice of gear. Plus, he made them UR gear, spending a ton of ressources, which are wasted. Because UR gear is “soft-locked“ to a specific hero name (for example all escanors). You can use it on other characters, but it won't give the UR bonus there.`1.0`2020-09-13 04:57:19`91.0
Their complaining about his gear, he has ur in every slot that r should be, and sr were the ur gear should be, also he has recovery gear on, typically the best build for escanor is full on attack/def`1.0`2020-09-13 11:11:42`91.0

"Speed up your runs mostly. Fastest on Global is Blue Guila, R Howser, R Gowther,  G Merlin back, and you want enough raw attack on Guila that she can one Tap the last wave with her Ultimate (when she gets it, which isn't 100% of the time, but enough of the time because the AI likes to prioritize her attack card, and her passive gives her 2 Ult gauge for free before last phase). Then you want a device that can run on Ultra and loads faster. 

You might not be able to change that last bit, but the first part makes a significant difference than if you are running something slower like BDM (who likes to corrode like everything)."`1.0`2020-09-13 14:01:07`96.0
It's not advisable, the AI favors debuff skills before attack skills, so in this case the AI will chose to play corossion instead of Mel's AOE, besides the reason this farming team is the most optimal is because of Guila herself and her passive. And in case there is no misunderstanding here we are talking about the blue guila not the red one.`3.0`2020-09-13 09:16:33`96.0

I have seen streamers calculate their runs at 50sec not including the in-between time which is also in-line with this person.

One thing people seem to miss is if you are spending to be on the top in a gacha game you just have to keep spending. There is no I have spent X so I can stay on the top indefinitely. The resource curve and unit power-creep is designed in such a way that small amount of spending does not give you a whole lot of benefit and newer players can pickup the game and catchup due to power creep. It is \*very\* intentional. It might seem counter intuitive as to why they do not capitalize more on the small spenders by providing more power advantage. However, if spending a little gave a lot of advantage it means you are cutting off a lot of population that is playing the game for free. In all these games these f2p and small spenders can almost be considered as the content the game provides (in the sense they are burning their time to provide entertainment to the high spending players). That said I do not mind spending a few bucks and usually do it on my way out. It might seem odd but I spend like 20-50 dollars before peacing out if I have played the game long enough. Also I specifically pick games where I have determined there is only a marginal advantage for the average spender and SDS is one of them.`7.0`2020-09-13 06:26:54`98.0
"As an f2p, i actually love the challenge of having to keep up, to get all the info I can, all in the name of efficiency.

I proudly can say i'm one of the best f2ps out here (2.6M box, 199k main team CC (before hp bonus), top 100 pvp twice), and it's all because of the info i get from everyone - youtubers, dataminers, gcdatabase, discord and twitter.

My box isn't too shabby despite f2p. I only miss 5 units, and but most of these i got from selected banners only. I've been really selective on banners to pull from, and i'm banking on the fact that the units i decided not to pull will return. As an example, in the LV banner, i got monspeet, snake girl, red king and blue ban for the first time, all of which i decided not pull on their own banners.

“I know that those kind of thought(s)..”

Power to you man. It’s very nice to hear that someone shares my concerns for the pacing and sneaky things NM has been pushing onto the global version. 

Like you, I’m gutted about the release of these cosmetic upgrade units being so close to these hype banners. With every banner release, I used to keep track how many more (f2p) gems JP was able to save before they got that specific banner. I quit doing that because the number was getting beyond crazy. 

I feel like with a game that has as much potential as this one, there shouldn’t be a need for NM to rush their earnings. The people that would spend money would just as well do so if NM would’ve stuck to normal JP pacing and kept the games apart. 

This pace hurts everyone, but it hurts the people that aren’t equipped to deal with it, a.k.a. everyone that isn’t an omega level whale who isn’t getting massively shafted across the board, the most.

"My biggest problem is the high costs in this game vs chance to pull.

I actually belive NM would make more money if they lowered the costs of gems and increased the chance to pull units from banners.

Now it feels that you need to spend a large amount to gain anything at all and that makes we don't  want to spend anything at all.

If i thought i could get a new unit each month for spending 10$ I would.
But even if I spend 100$ it is a low chance and that makes me don't want to spend at all.
I believe there is many like me out there going f2p because of this.

In my previos gacha I could spend 100$ and be set for 3-6 months depending on banners.
I payed in total 500$ in that game before quiting.

In this? Almost nothing.

So NM, maybe change strategy?"`4.0`2020-09-13 06:27:13`98.0
"You're right with that.

I really wish the game was a bit more like Tokyo Ghoul:re birth/invoke with it's banners, sadly this game got shut down (literally as a first anniversary celebration) because bandai never made more content to keep players interested and use these crazy powerful units in.

That game had a few diffrent types of banners: Festival Banners (7 steps) , Special/Exclusive ( 5 or 9 steps) Banners, Character B Day Banners (only available once a year, 3 steps) and Anniversary Banners (game anniversary and half year anniversary, 10 steps)

Each Banner differed in the amount of special currency (in this case it's called Kaku but there is no difference to Gems in SDS Grand Cross) needed to get a guaranteed copy of the unit that was on the Banner.

The most common type were festival banners: First step always cost 30, second was 40, third was 50 with a guaranteed SSR, fourth was 40, fifth was 50 with a guaranteed SSR of that banner type, sixth was 40 and seventh was 50 with a guaranteed copy of the feature unit.

Each banner had all the previous units of that banner type on it (unless there were multiple at the same time) as well as a a big amount of filler SSR's that were on every banner and the unit that was featured always had 0.5-1% rate up depending on the banner type. You usually had a 5% chance to get an SSR character.

&#x200B;

If SDS had a banner system more similair to this it would feel a lot better, cause this way you could ensure your gem saving wasn't for nothing. You might not be able to get any unit immediatly cause the banners are released quickly (same as TG:re birth/invoke) and you won't be able to get enough gems in time, but at least you could get the ones you really want.

With the current system there is just no reason at all to even spend any gems on a banner without guaranteed steps (most banners) because you'll most likely get shafted anyways and wasted all your gems for the next banner with guaranteed steps.

I don't care if it takes 300-400 gems to get a unit guaranteed like it did on TG:re Birth/invoke even if it's a double feature sometimes and you only have a 50/50 chance, but at least give us a guaranteed step on all banners so we don't just have to waste all our gems to get nothing at all.

Anniversary Banners would probably be the equivalent of Festival Banners and these cost 450 kaku in TG:re birth/invoke, but i wouldn't mind it too much if they stay at 900 in SDS, cause they are not happening THAT often as long as you can choose the unit you want at the end. Having a 0.5% or at least 0.33% rate up for the new character would probably also be nice on these...

There are already enough ways for Whales to beat F2P with better Gear, Ult lvl, Super Awakening, Cosmetics etc. no need to make the units that hard to get that you can't even get them while they are good as a F2P.

"I read all of this and I have to say I’m with you. I’ve played dozens of Gacha games. But only two have I spent in money besides this. First was I Am MT/Epic Heroes. It was fine but died too fast. 

Next was Brave Frontier. I loved this game. I started playing when it was really new. I played and spent like mad. But the devs started being unhappy with the traditional JPBF units and added global specific units. That’s fine, not unusual. But then came limited edition units. This was the start of the end. The speed at which they released these broken limited edition units was maddening. Im not kidding when I say there was a month when we got four limited editions in one 30 day period. With awful drop rates for summoning to boot. Eventually the game got fucked up. They had to keep power creeping to make the newest LE good. And it also had the side effect of making the monthly JPBF units that would come pointless. 

Eventually I had to just quit. I couldn’t keep up with buying gems to try to get the latest broken unit. PvP was a wreck due to them. 

I was having a great time in 7DS as I just started recently and I’ve already spent a couple hundred bucks. But if what OP says is true and that we’re going to get 6 limited edition units soon I may just have to quit before I get too deep.

That's where I understood the pace of the game is going to stay this fast until we catch up. It will be pointless to put too much money/resources in one character when it is going to expire the next week. The only question for me was ""what about those filler units?"", until the last youtube update came out. Are we really going to get 6 characters at once? I hope I misunderstood it, since we are still getting comandaments as well (zeldris on the 22nd if the pvp rules are right). It's a no stop bombardment lol. I found my sanity by playing and pulling only for the characters I like (zeldris is the last one of my list, so after that I'm good) but I imagine collectors who spend money on the game must have already sold a kidney to get the tier 1 units we got so far. What are they going to do now? I mean if they speed up the release schedule more we might end getting Liz in a month, what then? Also can we know why they want to get us to Japan in terms of characters release but we are so slow to get everything else? Level 80? New story chapters? S2 reverse stages?

Imo this is a good thing all around if nothing else just so everyone’s not saving for the next broken character that jp has and we can actually learn together. I played another mobile game that also wanted to sync up with the jp side so they decided to simply skip all non meta characters and not release them on the global server which made some people super mad but then on GC I see people getting mad at them releasing everything at a faster rate instead. 

Do you think we just shouldn’t sync up with jp? I’m sure you’re at least aware of how syncing up can benefit NM financially and (arguably) makes for a more fun experience

my rule is that I only spend money on games after playing them for an entire year. after 12 months or so I evaluate the game and the developers and ask myself how much I enjoy it, I use my roasted-chicken-O-meter which is: have I gained an amount of fun from the game equal to If I used this amount of money on roasted chickens meals from my local restaurant. if the answer is yes then I spend this amount of money on the game.

so yeah, I did spend on a number of PC games but haven't spend a dime on a mobile game. every time I consider spending I look at the prices and be like...4 multis for the price of 10-20 roasted chicken meals can't be right.

Obviously the tails of the probabilities can overlap in the very lucky/unlucky ends, but without a doubt by spending money your expected position will be better, so there is very much a logical reason to think the outcome will be better.

Edit: as for the the Lilia rates there is a reason she has low rates. She already had a step up which guaranteed her at 242 gems similiar to mono. Hence the reason why in the future step ups of new oc she has lower rates. It's annoying for new players as they missed her step up but in a way you also can't fault them cause the future oc step up banners are more geared towards getting the new oc units instead of the old one."`1.0`2020-09-13 16:48:35`98.0
For me it's already been non stop grind for the past few weeks but sadly you can't grind gems... Despite having a bunch of UR sets and proper teams it feels like I have to play even more with each coming week`2.0`2020-09-13 10:05:19`98.0

For me the worst thing about the fast pace we're going is the fact that all the units get outdated so quickly. If you spend all you have on a unit you'd expect to use it for at least some time, while now we get meta units almost every week. Don't get me wrong, no one is forcing anyone to play only with the best possible team, but if built a unit not even a month ago and now whenever you try to use it you get 30% win rate it's not a great experience. Also think about the resources that we have at our disposal. JP players had much more time to collect gems and tickets so when super awakening came it wasn't such a big expense to 4* main team. I have ppl in knighthood who barely have coins to buy CS units on discount and now imagine them trying to pvp against opponents with much more cc and stats. Being F2P doesn't mean you can't compete in top pvp, but with changes coming so fast they'll be hopelessly underpowered for quite some time`2.0`2020-09-13 07:33:27`98.0

"Remember the old days when Orlandu/Fryevia were good for almost an entire year?  Sure, they were powercrept, but everyone still used them because they cleared content fine.  At some point, FFBE went into overdrive where the next DPS unit was always a certain percentage better.  When you get better by the percentage, power creep accelerates so fast that older units gets left behind fast.  

I quit FFBE for this because of SDSGC having units that were good even as a SR base, but now it's becoming quite clear that you won't be relevant unless you keep chasing the new units.  It's only a matter of time before this is like every other gacha.

As an aside I started playing FFBE a bit again when NV came out and the amount of grinding they introduced for it is unreal.  I stuck around for all of the first banner (FF7R) before realizing it was just going to be a repeat of fast power creep...but now with tons of extra grinding!"`2.0`2020-09-13 12:20:59`98.0

To be FAIR...FFBE does more for older units than most Gacha games. They usually have some form of ability awakening (and most recently, NV) on older units roughly a year after release to bring them back into the current content. Like someone else posted, OG Tifa became one of the strongest units in the game with her NV awakening. The whole NV system alone also fixes the dupe system almost completely. I have over 4 years on the game and soft quit beginning of this year but with the release of NV I am having a blast with it again. Haven't spent a single penny.

I’m sure when we get caught up with jp we’ll be at the same pace as them. My question was what would you have them do differently to sync us up?

Sorry but that's very hard to believe and is honestly impossible. You absolutely have to grind like crazy to even try and keep up with spenders no exception. What is your box cc? I can see a world you can have that much cc on a team without grinding like crazy if you hard focused on that team alone and had a crazy ton of luck which most likely seems to be the case with you as you say you are f2p. But what about other teams? There us no way you have much other teams built up with ur gear sets for them as ell etc if you haven't been grinding. There is no way your box cc is high because if it is then you absolutely have been grinding like crazy because that's the only way you could have gotten it high even paying since launch. And how about gold? You absolutely have to grind alot to keep up with that.

How do you actually figure out how to build a character? For example, on sdsgc it lists red escanor as Hp/Defense. Why would I build him health over attack?

"Red escanor is a pretty rare case of a dps that can do hp/def. This is because of a couple things, mainly 3, 1. His passive scales incredibly with high hp. So the higher his hp the more hp his passive gives and he basically becomes unkillable the first few turns. 2. Because of how is amplify card works, he doesn't really need attack gear to one shot characters. If you get a level 3 arthur buff, and a level 2 or 3 escanor amplify card he's gonna oneshot who he wants even with hp/def. 3. CC. Going for is HUGE, especially for mono red, so having the extra hp on your escanor could be the difference of going first or going second.

Mikasa I can't really say. I get what you mean, that with more hp she'd stay alive longer for her passive to stack up, but I feel like she still wants attack/def due to her being a dps.

Same thing. Pretty pissed`2.0`2020-09-14 03:48:33`101.0
"just wanted to give an update on the current status. Got a response from netmarble this morning just saying that it's an automated system and my account was flagged. So it seems that there is no hope to lift the ban before the due date.

Someone mentioned if I disconnected often during pvp and that might have happen. My wifi was very unstable and I get disconnected when it happens. Not sure how that is an exploit since I automatically lose the match. The only thing that I used to give me an advantage over other players was my credit card...

I am very disappointed in the way this all turned out and it changed how I will play the game from now on. I have spent more than I should on a mobile game and the netmarble just doesnt care. Will still continue playing it casually because I still enjoy the content. But I cannot support or recommend this game to anyone and will for sure continue to share my experience with friends and family.

Someone in the netmarble bugs forum also mentioned how the recent bans could be due to their auto ban bot from PVP false reports since the bans also coincide with Netmarble's introduction of the PVP report feature.

What was the failure rate calculated in the 14mil gold and 3k stones?`1.0`2020-09-13 06:01:43`103.0
More math-y: for the 80% success to enhance a tier 1 item, we expect to have to do 6.25 enhancements on average to do all 5. For the 60% tier 2, 8.33. For 40% tier 3, 12.5, and finally 25 for the 20% tier 4. These are via the [Negative Binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution#Definitions). On average these cost 12000/19500/27000/34500 gold and 10/10/15/15 stones each, so with the tier 0 upgrades a total of 1.46m gold and 708 red stones for each item. That compares with the reported 2.17m and 500 red stones. By using the bar when an enhancement is expensive and letting it fill up when it is cheap, the averages can be brought down a lot. There is still a discrepancy because I would expect both reported stones and gold to be lower than the expected values due to using the bar. So it is possible my calculations have a mistake.`1.0`2020-09-13 06:17:35`103.0

If you leave it on auto, it will wait until it will get you a guaranteed 100%. If that is on the 1* at 80% or the 5* at 10%.

Honestly didn’t take notes on it, but I did use the bar after 3* awakening. One of the pieces I actually didn’t use the bar at all when enhancing at 4* which skews the totals a lot.

HP/Def gear gives the most CC. Outside of gear everything helps (ULT levels, cosmetics, awakening, associations)`9.0`2020-09-13 09:57:36`104.0
"Ult levels add.. 200 CC per level, IIRC.

Also, sub heroes matter:
* A 1/6 sub adds 5% of their basic stats, while a 6/6 sub adds 10%; an SSR has higher base stats than an SR (but are more expensive/difficult to level their ults); * Level 80, max awakening
* Heroes that have a link giving attack/def/HP are more valuable than those that don’t
* If they give a combined attack (e.g. Jericho/Guila, Gowther/King, Escanor/Merlin), it also gives +1k CC and a bonus to a stat

Past that, it’s all about gear and substats. 4 attack or HP pieces with 2 Def pieces is standard^^1, but having a high primary stat (e.g. attack on bracers) is **extremely** important, as when you UR it the bonus from UR is dependent on it. Substats should always^^2 be attack/def/HP bonuses.

While you don’t *need* SSR RHS gear, and R will suffice, it *does* add a not insignificant amount of CC to use SSR/UR RHS. LHS is more important, but you’re not going to do well in geared PvP without all (or nearly all) SSR/UR pieces on your primary team.

I forget the CC valuation on each stat, but in terms of +% increases on a stat, +1% HP > +1% Attack >= +1% Defense > pretty much everything else 

Notes/Caveats:

^^1 Some Heroes do best when bucking this convention, e.g. G Diane is 6 Defense pieces, 6 Defense pieces on R Gowther for the S1 Guild Boss w/ resistance substats, full crit damage sets with standard base stats on G Jericho, R Levi, and basically any hero with a high crit rate and high base attack. This sacrifices CC, and is usually only used in PvE content where scoring relies on BIG numbers (guild bosses, final bosses), or because you’re taking advantage of their unique and/or skills for a very specific company.

^^2 There are exceptions to this, but they’re very character-specific (e.g. all pierce on B Lilia/R Howzer/BDM/G Gustav, all resistance on G Valenti) and come at the cost of CC. While a full pierce BDM will Deal more damage than a full attack BDM, you sacrifice a lot of CC – may not be worth it, especially since a full pierce set isn’t useful for any other Meliodas, so you’d need 120 engraving stones for 2 different Meliodas sets."`7.0`2020-09-13 10:19:12`104.0

"No, Green Meliodas uses HP/Def, as his counter is based on (max HP - current HP).

Broadly speaking, the “best” set is almost always HP/Def for every hero, as it gives the most CC; however, to run it effectively you need to have 6/6 ults and full UR sets for all heroes and their subs (and the right subs).

Barring that, there’s a lot of personal preference that goes into it. BDM *could* get away with HP/Def if you went full pierce, but you’re probably better off with full attack substats with an attack/def set. CC is very important, given the ult rush meta we’re in."`1.0`2020-09-14 18:00:42`104.0

Most of mine were originally from events like the bingo and login rewards. A more consistent source is the Event dungeon with a rate up tavern cosmetic equipped. This requires farming friendship coins to get that daily event key from the friendship shop. I farm friendship coins through tavern visits, having a full friend list of active people who send daily coins and borrow your units for story progress, and by sending coins daily to all friends (the tavern cosmetic boosting friendship coins also helps). With 2000 daily coins one can get that daily event key from the shop. More recently clearing all the knighthood weekly boss rewards has been important. For that, I had to build specific teams to get a decent score on the hardest difficulty.`2.0`2020-09-12 20:45:16`109.0

It's cool, you've got yourself a pretty good box there, you're definitely good after such a short time.

"Oh yeah, I remember those stages, they were a pain in the ass. I recommend using the ""mercenary"" units from other players, it really makes doing the story missions easier, especially until you can assemble a solid team. Though I gotta say, if you're still struggling with the regular story, don't aim for the reverse stages, they're *extra* hard, you need fully maxed out specific characters, and even then it's often a matter of luck... But progressing with the story is definitely useful, since you get a lot of rewards from it."`2.0`2020-09-13 03:01:30`109.0
My top two tips for meeting cc requirements is; 1) use cc food, it makes your life much easier with that extra 10%. You'd only need to hit ~102k for that mission, and cc food would cover the rest. 2) use hp gear on your units. HP gives the most cc, so using good HP gear can boost your cc a lot, even just R sets can make do, the awakening bonus percentages of HP will do much more than the base stats of the gear.`2.0`2020-09-13 03:06:38`109.0

"Short answer, No.

Long answer is if you take a f2p friendly game as one where you can compete for high scores without whaling, this is not for you, and even if f2p players can reach certain scores now, things will get even harder with future content like SuperAwakening or Cosmetic upgrades, plus we're rushing like hell in global, so don't expect to pull on every good or meta banner... 

BUT If you want to collect units and play at your own pace while watching the story and doing pvp and raids at your level, without trying to reach the top, you should be fine.

"The answer you would be searching is this:

If you think you should skip Meli for Liz, then skip Liz for King, then inevitably, you’re going to think you should skip King for the next Festival unit and then the cycle will continue.

While there is some truth to thinking a 1/6 Festival unit is most likely underwhelming, keep in mind that while yes, we all want dupes for the fest unit; the entire content of the banner has to be considered. As of now Meli’s banner is arguably the best we’ve had from a total unit standpoint thus far. Liz’s banner was voted on, and thus it will most likely be even better. King’s, if they keep it the same, is pretty good since it featured a large portion of the coin shop units but if you have a good amount of them maxed out by the time it comes, it’s not a good banner for you.

So sure, saving up 900 is hard and you have to be carefully considerate of who to summon for, but you also can’t keep thinking that a better banner is going to come at all times; otherwise you end up paralyzed from summons for a long time.

Also, take into consideration how well both Liz and Meli do outside of PvP. I’ve seen numerous people using them with the Tower of Trials event as well."`23.0`2020-09-14 04:18:44`111.0

If we start thinking this way there will always be the next biggest thing that is better and the power creep is by design. You will be saving forever. You have to think about more in what is the return on investment on these units in a 1-2 month time frame.`1.0`2020-09-14 04:21:41`111.0
I believe if netmarble keeps the pattern of 2 months between banners and having the banner last a full month, then it is enough to save for the festival units. It’s hard because as F2P you have to be smart with your gems and what you summon on. For example people want to summon on zeldris if his banner is released soon but the good one is CS unit and may be on Liz banner. Festival banners are a good way to get a lot of units You’re missing and would mean not summoning unless it’s a good OC character set up. With the banners also lasting a month it also gives you time to get the 900 if you’re running short as well.`1.0`2020-09-14 04:43:07`111.0
2 months is enough to get 900 diamonds. Actually closer to 1200 if you're champ 1 in ungeared all the time. So if you pull on Liz, then you will be able to pull on fes king if you skip banners in between.`1.0`2020-09-14 18:22:41`111.0

The way festival banners are set up, it never made any sense to summon for lostvayne meliodas. Without a rateup, it always made waiting for the banner to be fleshed out the best choice. Japan deviated from that with festival king's banner, though, making the elizabeth banner worthwhile (you also couldn't select her on king's banner mileage).`-7.0`2020-09-14 05:12:56`111.0
Purple Hawk is only meta until the first half of 2022, if you want longevity you should pull on Demon King Red Meliodas, he wont be released until 2024 but he'll be relevant until the game is discontinued.`15.0`2020-09-14 04:47:01`111.0

Yes, that's what I was talking about. The rates for them are lower than the rates are now, or likely will be on the elizabeth banner. That's why it makes no sense to pull now for lostvayne, or pull later for elizabeth. Whether you want lostvayne or elizabeth, elizabeth's banner is the best so far."`1.0`2020-09-14 06:59:59`111.0

Nah man those all are unworthy of my 900 gems. When  rainbow colored Daddy finally shows up around year 3000, that's when every heroes in the game will be absolute. His ulti skill called Geh Sun which will decrease every opponents' atk by 99% but will also heal 99% of every allies hp. His first skill called Fabulous will  100% ko one enemy if his hp is 100%, his second skill called Rainbow counter will full counter any debuff or attack given to him. Lastly his passive is the best one called LGBTQ WHICH WILL REVIVE HIM INTO SEVERAL Previous version of his Escanor color if he was KOed with one hit. Now that's a hero worthy of summoning!`3.0`2020-09-14 14:41:34`111.0
"But if you spend all your gems summoning him, you will be left behind in terms of UUUSUSUSUSUUR Gears.

You will need at least 25 sets of Body Hair Sets and 12 Facial Hair Sets, not to mention the gems required to quadruple awaken them. 

Without those gears, your rainbow colored Daddy will just be fodder for the Ice Cream Tower of Sugar Coated Shaft Chocolates.

Much better to invest those gems on UUUSUSUSUSUUR Gears, while you wait for Rainbow Daddy to be in the same banner as Green Boner Fat King. That festival banner also gives you a chance to pull Boner Grayroad, which will be PvP meta for a grand total of 3 days and 7 hours."`2.0`2020-09-14 16:30:31`111.0
"wouldn't HP/def be alot better on her, I mean she isn't a dps character and she is super annoying and a primary target if her passive lands right so isn't better to make her survive for as long as possible?

anyway, substats is attack only, crit damage benefits characters with incredibly high critical chance or card types such as sever and spike, deldry attack card only hit once iirc and her crit chance is super low so crit damage substats is waste on her. not to mention atk gives more cc than crit dmg."`21.0`2020-09-13 10:13:54`112.0

Mm, gonna disagree here. HP/Def is going to be more useful, as if her Charm effect lands on, say, B King or G Merlin, you’re going to want to survive some hits while still throwing out taunts/redirects. Yeah, damage suffers, but she’ll have more survivability to get a couple of ults off and won’t be stopped getting them off.`8.0`2020-09-13 10:25:04`112.0

Yeah I mean that's what politics are. But I understand your sentiment.  8 years ago I would have agreed with you that the ""democrats vs Republicans"" paradigm is tired and bullshit because they're the same. Especially the RINO(Republican in name only) horrible neo-con, war hungry presidential candidates like McCain and Romney. All they wanted were an extension to endless wars while pushing keynsian economic solutions putting us trillions more into debt.

However, nowadays it's not really Dem vs. republican, Good vs. evil, it's more like Common sense vs. Stupidity. Sadly, there are no centrists or stable thinkers left in the Democratic party, only true-believer radicals and politically ignorant or misinformed people.

Now its Hollywood Elites/Silicon Valley/Mainstream Media/Corporations/War hungry Military Industrial complex vs. The American middle class. I'm sure you can tell which side is which.

It's funny because it used to be the Republicans who were the big corporation and Wall Street guys but now because of the indoctrination(and its not a conspiracy theory, happens everyday, check out *Turning point USA* or *Project Veritas'* stings) happening in our College campuses, the roles are reversed. Edit: thank you democrats for brainwashing our worst consitutients! Great job!

"Don’t know why you’re getting downvoted.

You shouldn’t UR the necklace or earring until you’ve UR’d the top two and bottom two pieces of your entire PvP team. The benefits from URing defensive pieces is minuscule in comparison to the attack/HP pieces and you’d be better off URing the attack/HP pieces for other units on your team. This is especially true for f2p players.

I don’t have a single unit with 6 UR pieces and have been in elite for the past 4 months. It’s kind of a waste of purple gems to make those middle pieces UR. But y’all do y’all."`10.0`2020-09-12 06:55:26`115.0

Run the repeatable red gear quests in chapters 1 through 3 during half stamina free stage events. You just missed it but it’ll be back in a couple weeks. I’m fairly new too and didn’t know this: only keep the SSR gear that has at least 90% of potential main stats. When you click into a specific gear piece, there’s a bar at the top, just under the picture icon, that tells you the current main stat. The main stat is random and isn’t worth rerolling with diamonds if you’re f2p. If your main stat is less than 90% of the possible total, +1 or +5 enhance the gear (don’t awaken) and salvage it (especially right now during the salvage event).`2.0`2020-09-13 04:41:24`115.0

I just did training cave today and none of my teams reach the 90k cp limit. Its not like u cant enter the battle u just go second. The official database has some great [teams](https://www.sdsgc.gg/teams/training-cave) u can use. For example there's a fight where u fight this red giant that does a lot of aoe attacks and the team u should be using is kingbram for perma patrify. Who cares if u go second and if he does too much dmg cause he 1-shots your units (which he really shouldnt) use a void food. A void food can be the reason that u're able to do a lv.3 fight, for example on red helbram my blue gowther is ssr lv 50 and would die instantly but because I use a void food he doesnt die and I can seal his debuff skills and win the fight. Or look at the fairy loli girl (green one). If u just use red Sr Slater u seal all her dmg skills (since all her dmg comes from debuff cards) and u can just kill her. Why would u need 90k cp if she doesnt hit u anyway because slater seals all her cards (exept ultimate).`13.0`2020-09-12 07:08:49`115.0

Anyway the thing about the training cave is that every battle have a gimmick that you can exploit, it's really easy but you need the ""right"" characters, from what I saw on your boss you'll have to level up the ones I showed you, they're mostly SR so you won't have a problem, of you don't have a unit and it's hard to get, test with something else.

If you go to: https://www.sdsgc.gg/teams/training-cave

You'll see a more in depth guide for each level 3 fight, on the right side of the teams there's a small arrow click on it and it will expand explaining the mechanics of each fight.

If I'm not mistaken you'll need 48 at least level 50-60 characters to complete it, these prints I gave you were from when I firstly beat every stage, these are the minimum I managed as a F2P, nowadays my teams are better a example is I switched Green Elaine for Green Monspiet for extra tankness."`2.0`2020-09-12 12:26:12`115.0

I don’t play geared, but I’d definitely prefer derieri and pen. The only one who can strip her buffs is green Escanor, and she can kill him pretty easily. Then you can get an evade and ult up and kill whoever else you want. My Escanor is only 2/6 so his ult isn’t always a guaranteed kill for me, whereas derieri is as long as I’ve got a buff card or a few attack buffs.`1.0`2020-09-13 01:30:14`116.0

I would suggest you rerolling a little bit (there is a rerolling guide on this sub. The method is the same but I would reccomend different units) until you get a good starting box so you don't struggle later on. I would suggest you pulling for either lostvayne meliodas or green Escanor (or both if you feel lucky lol).
- lostvayne meliodas is one of the strongest units in the game for pvp and can carry you through your story missions.
- escanor is also pretty strong in pvp and pretty good for the story.

 lvmeli is definetly the better choice for pvp and for story it depends on the enemy. Both are obtainable from the lost vayne meliodas festival banner.

Just bear in mind that lostvayne meliodas is a festival unit and will only be obtainable through festival banners like the half year one we have right now while escanor is a permanent part of the part 2 banner.

You'll also as a new player be guaranteed Red Gowther after logging in for 4 weeks who is a really crucial unit and one of the best supporters out there.

I would like to add that beside LV and Green Escanor there is another great option if you care mostly for PvE content:

* Red Derieri, she's the strongest single target dps unit in the game and can deal WAY more dmg than any other character in the game. She's going to make any story content and a lot of other PvE stuff extremly easy for a long time, even on Jp there is no unit that's stronger than her.

Derieri is also useable in PvP with a good ult rush strategy cause her self buff card with Avoid can be extremly annoying for the enemies, they just can't do anything against her when she dodges all attacks, and she'll definatly one-shot kill an enemy unit turn 2, which is enough to screw over a lot of team comps, unless she gets crowd controlled (freeze, petrify or ult gauge removal) by the enemy turn one cause non ult rush teams usually go first due to CC food."`1.0`2020-09-13 05:09:26`121.0

Hp/def is a good way to go for more cc and survivability, but if your Gowther has a high ult level already atk gear can help his ult hit quite hard.

2. Was that rank 2 card the single target one then it was probably why LV got an additional orb 3. Nothing after Champ 1 so the only benefit of climbing there is the maximum gems of that PvP week`2.0`2020-09-13 09:44:24`121.0
"1) Elite PVP you lose 1 division every week and you will drop a tier if you're in div 5.

Ex1: Champ 1 becomes Champ 2. 

Ex2: Champ 5 becomes Masters 1. 

2) Some characters rank two or higher cards will add an additional orb(s) when used. Think G Esca and LV Meli. This is why we put G Esca on the far left and hope his cards combine at the start.   


3) You can get into the top 100 but it's still considered Champ 1 and the rewards are the same."`1.0`2020-09-13 09:54:20`121.0
"Hiya! So training grotto is a really useful resource that unlocks every 4 days as your grotto key naturally regenerates after 4 days, though the grotto is open for a week after you unlock it each time. The spontaneous quests usually just ask you to clear a stage, and the reward will be a gem, engraving stone, less stam, etc. They pop up randomly as you continue to clear more training grotto fights. Each time you do training grotto you can complete up to 9 fights, so clearing 3 would count as 1/3 of the possible 9 quests. It doesn't matter what level fights you choose (1, 2, or 3) but keep in mind that higher difficulties give better rewards and clearing all lvl 3 fights gives you 3 shadow fights against your own previously used teams.

Is your kings ult 6/6? Just because it hits like 15 trucks when maxed but even at 3 or 4/6 it still is more than enough damage wise. I've been in champ for awhile now and it just gets boring using the same few teams over and over again. I dont grind pvp to get to champ 1 or fight for top ranks (the gem difference between 1 and 5 is negligible imo) so I'd rather play weird or interesting teams and lose 9 of 10 matches than play rock paper scissors with the same 3 meta comps.`1.0`2020-09-13 06:19:07`122.0
"Lol, but pierce doesn’t “clap” an lv meli ult rush team as hard as you had stated. You implied from this initial statement that they’d pretty much wipe the floor with all teams that didn’t have “protection.” My point was that this isn’t true, and if lv meli ult rush has red king, it’s pretty much an automatic loss... 

If they don’t have red king, 50/50 depending on rng, if they do have red king, GG. Therefore, lv meli ult rush beats pen 3/4 times probably. (Unless this is in low tier PvP which I’m not sure what it’s like then)"`2.0`2020-09-12 23:51:44`122.0

Also, the company behind does not care about the player base or talks to them.

You’re getting downvoted because this subreddit loves complaining EVERY TIME new units come out but it is by far the most free to play friendly gacha game out there. Right now, its the community’s belief that Global is trying to catch up to the Japan server (which is a couple months ahead in terms of content) and therefore is churning units out weekly instead of biweekly. This means F2P cant save up fast enough to have a chance summoning on every banner. Thing is F2P doesn’t need every character and thanks to the Japanese server its easy to know which to summon on and which to wait. For instance, I didn’t summon for like two months and then went ham on Derieri and LV Meli. Outside of summoning the demon you want, these units see no play so all these players are complaining about is missing out on a convenience. Does it suck? Im not gonna say it doesn’t but its really not that bad. Like you said, other gacha games are entirely paywall or take months to grind one character.`-2.0`2020-09-12 02:24:20`124.0

\- They have pity timers but those at 19 and 28 multipulls which is A LOT.

\- They barely give any currency to pull **outside of achievements**:

30x7 for dailies, 250 weekly, 60x7 for another daily quests, \~700 for pvp. So you can barely do two multupulls per week if you DO EVERYTHING. So basically \~1400 XES while one multipull is 700 XES.

\- They ""revamped"" labyrinth which was a good source of cash currency at release, made it WAY WORSE and cut most the XES rewards from it.

\- They just introduced new OP system which is basically increases the damage of all your units by A LOT and a requirement to it is to have a ""general"" unit (chance to get 0.2%) transcended (aka to get a dupe) and then sacrifice another dupe. Whole Exos Heroes subreddit is up in arms already.

\- Monthly challenging quests are scummy and can be completed only by whales.

\- DIfficulty of new content is so high that even whales are struggling to do it and you need to complete it to have an access to new tier of the best gear there. Rip f2p.

You get a free pull every 8 hours able to give you any possible unit.

Currency is indeed not that common, but as a casual I can gather currency in a decent way in booth games.

The exos passes are paid like the hawk passes really they are the same, i would argue you get more from exo passes, but really it is something i dont do.  
The new ch are indeed very difficult, but as a casual f2p i cant do grotto reverse or extreme bosses too.  
  
They are mostly comparable, but exos is really more generous, they just gave free fated bernadette, and now they gave for free the new fated unit, they just gave 7 day x 1 multi that gave you chance to get any unit in the game, not like the free multi on blue arthur banner that wasnt just worth for ssr coins, they just gave the chance to choose to get the best unit in the game...  
  
I know for a fact exo is more generous cause im playing for less than a month and got a good amount of the best units and gear.  
I am playing since day one at sdgc and I barely got 4 set of ssr and not even a single ur gear.

Super Awakening is no near close to powercreep Signature Force has introduced. And to fully unlock Signature Force just for one nation (out of 6) you need 17 dupes of super rare unit. 

> The new ch are indeed very difficult, but as a casual f2p i cant do grotto reverse or extreme bosses too.

There's a difference when casual cannot do something, and when even hardcore f2p/veterans/whales cannot do something like in Exos Heroes

> they just gave free fated bernadette

Meanwhile, 7ds gave for free SSR ARthur, SSR Fraudrin, SSR Slater and will give for free SSR green King and SSR Ban.

Also Exos Heroes banners last only one week. While in Grand Cross 2 weeks. And I like how you're comparing fated units to our SSR, while fated units in exos heroes are trash. You need Fatecores which has only 1% chance to drop. Also there's a gear gacha for premium currency.

7ds gives more free currency to pull

7ds gives more free characters (free ssr1 ticket weekly + many other content which rewards ssr tickets, from story to reverse stages)

7ds doesn't have bullshit taxes like paying XES for unequipping fated items.

7ds doesn't have pay-to-win system which requires 17 dupes of super rare unit.

You are a smart man then. The Goddess Elizabeth one might be way better and we will probably have the missing units from part 2 banner in there like Derieri etc. And most importantly you will be able to choose between her and LV at 900.`1.0`2020-09-15 06:02:22`126.0

No, my definition of white knight is anyone that goes trough heaps of logic to excuse bad practices and consumer abuse that CERTAIN gachas companies like to practice, you fall on this category, i'm not saying they shouldnt make money, what i am saying is this bs that they are pulling NOW (its almost like a pattern at the moment, netmarble does one really good and awesome thing to global players, and then they pull off 2 to 3 scummy moves after) is complete cancer and show just how complete and utter shit some gachas companies can be.

It's way better than only 2 weeks which is the case here releasing these units just 2 weeks after LV. Deri came out 2 weeks before LV and there are people that still pulled on her even knowing LV was likely to come in 2 weeks for half anni.`4.0`2020-09-12 03:44:56`126.0

"You are assuming a lot here. Point out one instance where I said predatory gacha is a great model or is even the right thing to do. I am just stating how the model works and how you can still do pretty ok in this specific game despite the model. All gacha models are extremely predatory I do not know of a single gacha game that is not. It is just a question of degree.

Coming to this specific instance the reason to be offended with this change to break it down is you want these 6 units for collection purposes. Then tough luck you gotta pay to collect everything. The other reason is they are gating something ,i.e., they spawn specific demons and give boost to cosmetic upgrade material. This is nice to have but is it a serious advantage no. There are already many aspects of the game that are far more p2w and this is the least of them imo.

Now lets look at these changes from my perspective. I do not give a shit about collecting all the units so I do not care. I usually have a store of demon mats of all kinds so spawning a specific demon is useless for me. The cosmetic upgrade material drop rate does seem nice but even that will have minimal impact because people who I am pvping with are decked out in purchased cosmetics and the upgrade material is going to do jack shit for me to change the situation. So in effect nothing has really changed for me.

It not some complex convoluted logic to defend netmarble or shitty gacha practices. It is basically assessing has the game become more p2w than it was before and from my perspective not really. Whatever was working for me will still work."`6.0`2020-09-12 05:18:52`126.0

"Also you’re still you’re missing out on value if you don’t go for the guaranteed everytime. Say you got lucky on lv in 500 gems. That’s still a waste, because if you hit 900 you could’ve gotten another copy. 

Same applies with banners outside of the fest banners. Say you pull on the valentines units as a f2p, even if you get what you want you probably will have spent too many gems and now won’t have 900 for goddess liz. 

Pretty much no matter how lucky you get in these games you’re not going to have gems for everything as a f2p, and it’s intentional."`1.0`2020-09-12 03:55:09`126.0

40% damage reflected is terrible and easily ignored. Lv’s ult 1/6 is honestly not the best either, but in geared it still does enough damage it doesn’t matter. Ungeared lv at 1/6 is pretty bad."`2.0`2020-09-12 03:59:30`126.0

I am a day 1 player btw and got champ 5 in the second week. That probably helped alot.

"Overall the game is fairly f2p. New units have pretty meh rates (.5 -> .25 at times) but powercreep is mostly fine, except for a few characters. PvE is super f2p friendly, with the exception of 1 event on JP any f2p player that summons on the ""right"" banners can do well in pve easily. PvP ungeared is also fairly f2p friendly imo, most of the meta teams are filled with coinshop units (units that you can buy with dupes) so they are easy to max out, then all you need to do is buy cosmetics from events (lots of f2p cosmetics) or gems. Geared pvp is where trouble starts imo, the difference between f2p player getting maxed out gear compared to a p2p player is insane, as the best gear in the game, UR Gear, is pretty much time-locked to 1-2 pieces per week, while p2p players can double or triple that, which causes whales to dominate geared pvp a lot more than ungeared IMO, though eventually f2p players catch up as there is more time to get UR Gear for their units. The next problem that shows up are P2P players being able to max out a unit instantly, which most f2ps won't be able to do, the only way a f2p can get close is it they skip a ton of banners (which isn't too hard tbh, a lot of the units in this game a super niche) but they probably wouldn't even get enough dupes then, I'd guess around 3-4"`2.0`2020-09-12 02:40:40`130.0
7DS is definitely imo better than DBL is every aspect except the rates. But from a f2p perspective yeh it's p2w unless you really tryhard the game and devote too much time on it and get really lucky on summons. But if you only wanna get some cute waifus and enjoy the story and final boss events then it's totally f2p.`2.0`2020-09-12 05:06:11`130.0
"F2p player here, this is my opinion, skip to TLDR if my English gives you headache 

Geared pvp is mostly Whale territory but Ungeared is pretty f2p provided that you're good/you got the new meta team

The rest is highly f2p with some OP chars on the coin shop (zeldris, Estarossa and Escanor, merlin and others)

Also the banner system might seem bad but as a Dokkan and BBS player being sure to have the new fest unit guaranteed (if you saved enough) is a true blessing

Also I'm on champion 5 Ungeared and if I do the daily missions the game gives me 91 gems per week (112 with the Solgres exploit) 

I don't even know how much games actually me 3 multis worth of resources just for doing the daily missions and that let me have the new OP fest unit after like 3 month """"""""only"""""""" of saving GUARANTEED 

Granted if you didn't get the new meta unit you might be less ranked on Ungeared but still the pvp gems is a extremely f2p feat

TL;DR: Coin shop and pvp gems are a f2p blessing, I wish the exact same system was on every gacha

Being able to save your gems to have the new OP unit GUARANTEED is really good compared to some other gacha games

No pve modes that are almost impossible without the new unit (you can just destroy everything with Monored, an entirely f2p team, or just by having Derieri) IM LOOKING AT YOU LEGENDS AND YOUR FRIEZA EVENT

Overall 8, 5/10 f2p value to me,just give guaranteed new unit on every banner along the normal pity system , and make it so fest units can be bought with normal plat coins (instead of fest plat coins) and that might be the most f2p game I've ever seen"`2.0`2020-09-12 05:14:15`130.0

"Right now and I mean RIGHT NOW, I don't think it's p2w, I played since launch and before I dropped the game for 2 months, I dropped it during the slime collab, got back when the Lilia banner was going out and kept playing to this day, during some weeks I would barely play sometimes only log in to check in on the guild. This is my experience with the game.

I can safely say before I stopped playing the first 2 months I was one of the strongest players in the game, high rank on PVP, CC was up to pair with the whales, I got every unit when they launched with F2P gems.

When I got back to the game I was behind but my teams could carry me through ungeared PVP, I could do all events but my CC was behind by 20k.

On the following weeks that sometimes I would play and sometimes not I was slowly grinding myself back, I think it was 3 weeks  back that I finally started to enjoy the game like I used to. With I carried myself to Champ 1 in ungeared just to see if I could still compete (I usually sit on Champ 5 just to get the 50 gems), I was using my trusty Pierce team, and was clapping everything even mono red, I got Deri, LV, and most ""needed"" characters.

This week I decided to climb geared with 173k, using a weird mono red team (Deri, LV, Gowther) and ult rushing them, I realized I could beat 200CC teams, if they don't get a god start or don't ult rush my team.

My overall opinion on the game is: It's by no mean P2W, of course people that spend loads will have advantage, but in this game if you play it normally you can stay competitive and get all the new units they release, it's really not that hard,  and I wonder if I never stopped playing I would be probably with 190k or even 200k being F2P."`3.0`2020-09-12 01:45:38`130.0

"Be a casual F2P unless you want to go through overnight farming and have your phone blow up (u can also just emulate the game through blue stacks on a pc). The rates in sins are terrible in comparison to legends (0.5% new unit compared to 1% new unit excluding LFs). Total SSR/SP rate in sins is 3% while legends sitting at 10% (which is some of the more above average rates you’ll see...). 

Zenkai system > super awakening, but super awakening didn’t come to global yet so who knows if they change anything. 

Grand cross isn’t a game that you can rush through and have “skill” (which takes 3rd place right behind RNG at #1 and MONEY at #2) to play in PvP. I suggest playing PvP all the way up to master 5 (because you fight bots) and then finish up story and enjoy whatever events they release until you have a meta team that can win you matches so then you go for Champion 5. The PvP battle ranking system is infinitely better than legends top 10k system but the PvP itself is quite bad imo. Powercreep in sins is funny too and basically puts all F2P who are serious about the game in a trance where all they do is save for the next meta character instead of spending on characters they like. You essentially have this pattern: one OP unit, a bunch of trash units, one OP unit, a bunch of trash units and so on. 3 of the most used units in the game are all free (only 1 in the sense of actually being free because you get them from story). Duping characters is very important as well.

I think it's still F2P, because you can still get a lot of diamonds if you save up right and play the daily missions at least 5 times a week. However, I'm mostly free to play, so from experience, always go on YouTube and and the data base online and see ALWAYS how good new characters are. You NEVER want to summon and realize the character's good on paper, but not actually good. Also, about equipment. People say it's impossible to get UR gear on free to play or at least 3 UR gear for each of all four of your PvP character for elite PvP, but that's not true. You just need to make sure you pay attention to events, like the bingo events or the lottery. You get some CRAZY good free to play stuff SO easily from things like this that are almost ALWAYS there in the game. I have almost full UR gear on my Escanor, green Merlin, and 10 extra tier 5 SSR gear saved for future good PvP characters and I still have a bunch tier 3 SSR gear so I have good characters for every element and for farming. Not only that, there are often events for basic enhancement and selling, like Dianes salvage. The only thing I buy is that 5 diamonds daily thing and if there is a good banner or those rare $1 deals for tier 5 R gear. Even if I didn't get that 5 diamonds daily thing, F2P can still grind up that in just a few minutes everyday (daily missions, Knighthood, event clear mission rewards, etc). Also, cosmetics are just SUCH a small boost that doesn't even matter and it's just weapons and hats. Also, I reached the same issue you're in too. You'll want to play all the events right not that give anvils and play the dungeon, then get those anvils and change all your PvP characters that have tier 5 gear affects, like pierce, crit, recovery, etc and change it ALL to stat boosts, so defense, attack, and hp ONLY, because pierce, crit, life steal, etc, will never be worth more than base stats (trust me, I've fallen for all those useless affects and lost lots of free to play resources). All together, you should have at least like 10% boost on all base stats. It can be higher, but bad rolls can be crazy high or crazy low sometimes.`0.0`2020-09-12 01:16:14`130.0

speaking from personal experience I was thankfully able to hit champion geared twice as f2p, the first was right after lillia dropped, I went for valenty banner instead and got to champion with escanor-merlin-valenty-gilthunder 176k cc , I stopped playing PvP after and went back to plat. the second was just last week after LV banner with LV-gowther-king-merlin/LV-valenty-king-merlin 195k cc. 

my advices for my fellow f2ps are:

1-to lay low and wait for windows when the meta is shifting before trying to blast off to champion, If I have to guess when are the next breaking points it would be during summer eastin banner, then during green drole banner then during king/hendi banner, as broken as Liz is she is only going to cement ult rush as the best team rather than shift the meta.

2- do buy taste of defeat food, they are games you can't afford to lose, it is better to play with taste for 3-5 games until you meet a bot than lose a game and drop from bottom master to plat.

3- if you couldn't catch up to a meta, ignore it and focus on the next meta, if you are starting from 0 after the meta have been established then by the time you fully build the perfect gear for the current meta it would have been shifting already. ex:did you miss your chance building UR perfect gear for king, build easitn/Liz and get them done in time for the banner."`1.0`2020-09-12 18:50:33`130.0

The 10% is the overall ssr rate and let’s be honest most SSR’s u get in Dokkan are actual dogshit with no use, so the 10% don’t really matter that much, but yeah I agree that 7DS should increase their rates (overall ssr rate, featured rates are actually ok), especially with features like super awakening coming in the future.`3.0`2020-09-12 03:07:37`130.0
"Yeah that sounds pretty bullshit lol they do print less copies of rarer cards in real life too, but I don’t like the concept of adding rarities like UR etc. to the cards. 

I paid $5 and I had a good starter blackwing deck going but I didn’t like how easily games snowball in duel links. It felt almost impossible to comeback, wasn’t really having fun even when winning because of how one-sided every match was. 

This is why nowadays the life point pool is 8000 but it feels like duel links is a weird mix of older yugioh rules but with the new OP cards."`2.0`2020-09-12 07:40:02`130.0
Even with pvp, the one that gives the best prizes is ungeared which is very f2p friendly. Also once you get to champion, where youll get the most amount of gems, you cant go any lower than champ 5 and the difference between champ 1 and 5 is like a dozen gems. Its only really in geared pvp that  p2p players have a big advantage but the prizes are nothing special so just skip it imo if you dont like grinding gear (like me)`0.0`2020-09-12 16:36:29`130.0
"Getting to champ 5 shouldn't be too hard right now. So far we only really have 1 of the very overpowered festival units (LV Meliodas) and he's not even that great by himself unless his ult lvl is beyond 4. 

Getting teams like Mono Red is very easy as well, Gowther is a must have and i believe you also get him for free as a login bonus if you're new, Red Arthur can be bought for 20-30 gold coins which isn't too difficult and Red Escanor can be bought for 5-7 plat coins which is difficult at first, but not too hard if you play a little while. The only unit thats slightly more difficult to get is Red King cause he's only on the Part 2 banner, but you could honestly just use R SR Griamore, R Howzer or even R Twigo as a sub unit to get a good boost for your team and be fine in most fights.

It's also not too difficult to get costumes for some of the most used unit's in PvP like King, Gowther and Merlin cause they get a lot of them from events. Aside from that it also really helps to get other units of the same name to UR or get them to max affection to gain more costumes. Might take a while, but you can get a decent amount of costumes for most characters this way."`0.0`2020-09-12 02:01:48`130.0

You’re not going to get every fest unit 5/6 in one rotation, and as a f2p you won’t be able to save for multiple rotations at the rate they release fest units. Geared pvp no matter how lucky you are pulling dupes, whoever’s spent more money and whoever’s done more overnight farming has an advantage over you. 

Tldr; just because you can have some degree of success in these games as a f2p doesn’t mean they’re not incredibly p2w. Go and try to get top 100 in geared pvp for example goodluck."`3.0`2020-09-12 02:54:17`130.0

Also, with the amount of good units they're pumping out to the unfeatured pool, along with the number of EZAs that older units are starting to get, the pool is not anywhere near as bad as it used to be.

well, if im not mistaken dokkan has 10% ssr rate and 5% featured rate. just the featured rate for dokkan is higher than the ssr rates for sds (3%), that generally includes a lot of unusable units. and the featured units from DFE banners are usually very good and usable, and my experience with SDS was banners with like 2 good characters and the rest is full of trash`2.0`2020-09-12 03:13:44`130.0

If u have 1000 gems and use those on a derieri banner for example u have a 81% chance to get a least 1 (Not counting the pity’s), which means getting good units as f2p is not as unreasonable as u’re making it out to be (even tho u should only really summon on festival banners if u actually care that much) and everybody that actually cared about pvp should have saved 900 gems for lv meliodas, which is gonna stay the best pvp unit for a while (a lot of people say he’s even the best pvp unit to this day on jpn)

>1 f2p friendly unit capable of competing in top pvp

Mono red still is super top tier and consists of 4 f2p units, than u still have units like G.Merlin B.King G.Estarossa and even more which are all VERY GOOD f2p units which are 100% capable of competing in top pvp, so Idk what ur talking about. I hit champion on ungeared with mono red which is a full f2p team and it’s not like I’m going to derank.

I don’t think anyone expected to just magically get challenger 1 every week with just one copy, but regardless people should summon on this banner cause even tho it’s only 1% it has better rates and some good units on the banner instead of the usual G.Griamore, G. Elaine and B. Hendrickson Gang and probably the most important part being that he is guaranteed. U could dumb those 900 gems on any other banner and get absolutely destroyed but with those banners u at least get the bare minimum instead of potentially nothing at all.`0.0`2020-09-12 17:34:11`130.0
My man can u please pass the blunt cause u seem to be smoking some good stuff. EVERYBODY is gonna summon on this game and is eventually able to buy R.Escanor/R.Gowther and Arthur dk what u’re saying. And u know that leveling your ult adds like 1,5k cc max, so idk why having a 1/6 lv means that I go second all the time. My lv is 2/6 and I go first a decent amount of time and the difference between 1/6 and 2/6 is like 300cc max probably only like 200`2.0`2020-09-12 17:24:03`130.0
each ult level is 500CC, so total is 2,5k CC extra. Assuming you summon only on garanteed banners and get only the garanteed SSR's, there's not enough currency yet to be able to get those 3 mono red units to 6/6. Feel free to do the maths to disprove this. So a 6/6 LVmeli + full PAID cosmetics will always be first and possibly even 1 turn some units`0.0`2020-09-12 23:14:33`130.0

First of all u don’t need full 6/6 units to win games. My king is 4/6 and my lv 2/6 and every time I get one of their ults the fight is pretty much over so dk what you’re talking about.

"Drew the guaranteed LV Meli with 900 gems. I may be able to barely pick up a LV Meli dupe with another rotation before it ends. Now I have a choice: 

&#x200B;

1) Draw for the guaranteed LV Meli dupe for 870 gems while trying for Meli dupes. Have most of what I want from this draw already, aside from G. Creation Diane to round it off. 

2) Do the Mono step up draw. Mono isn't great, but I could use Valenti, plus get Lilia dupes. Also, at least Mono's guaranteed. 

3) Wait for the 6 units rate up draw and splurge. Don't really find rate up draws worth it and the 6 units aren't top tier. The main pro is that these are 6 new, limited units with certain perks, which I don't really care for.

Mm yeah; at some point you'll probably have your full box 6\* so reverse stages won't be as difficult. There are some guides here on Reddit for reverse stages. Agree that the characters should be minimum lvl 60 and 6\* and R and SR characters should preferably have 6/6 ult or close to that to help reach the desired cc. Ult food works well for most of these stages if you meet the cc, and if not cc food or hp food is fine also.`3.0`2020-09-12 06:00:25`136.0

You have to use sladers debuff on the first phase and Attack seal. Get Gowthers ult and another Attack seal the next phase. Ult with Gowther and Attack seal. Escanor will cruel sun ruin cuz lowest HP. You need to get a deri deri ult next turn to kill the first phase. Then carry over a blue card and 2 level 3 attacks from deri deri to one shot the final stage. If you use ruin to remove his HP buff use a level 2 and 3 card then you will not trigger his invincibility`12.0`2020-09-11 06:03:53`137.0
That's super awakening. It'll be coming to global in the next few months, it gives you more awakening levels in addition to the 6 normal ones.

Every hour I can do like 3 complete runs. So it’s not the best strat. You can stop his AOE in the first phase with the Attack seal you have to ult with Gowther to prevent escanor from gaining max ult gauge to remove the Attack seal. Very complicated strat and not really the most reliable but I couldn’t find any other strat without mono. :/ maybe you can try the recent seatin strat but I didn’t have those units upgraded so I didn’t use it`3.0`2020-09-11 06:31:15`137.0

First, we don't really know when it's coming. But even if it's coming in few months, it still will be very close to when JP got it. I mean few months from now is like 7-9 months from the release of the game. With our pacing it's fine.`1.0`2020-09-12 03:36:28`137.0

Yeah i know but maybe he gave her a nickname lol`1.0`2020-09-11 17:51:09`137.0
I am in challenger and I run her with hp/def. Most if not all heroes should be running hp/def. Gear. I believe deri, jeri, escanor and Meliodas and only ones in game currently who should run different gear. Hp/def gives you more cc so you can go first ( which matters A LOT ) and more survivability. Lilia isn't meant to be dmg hero, she is utility hero. It's better to have alive Lilia that hits a bit weaker than to have dead Lilia that hits hard ( but she doesn't hit hard either way )`6.0`2020-09-12 21:20:38`138.0
id do atk/def with pierce rolls since it benefits her heal and her whole passive is based around that`3.0`2020-09-11 17:59:42`138.0
I run attack defense with all pierce rolls might switch to half pierce half attack when the new Lillia comes. She works well in geared pvp this way healing is much better`1.0`2020-09-12 07:06:51`138.0
its for her to survive for her passive, once she dies her passive is gone and bdm or any other pierce unit basically does no damage. And also CC`1.0`2020-09-13 02:40:06`138.0

I don't do geared pvp tho so I it's not like I'm shooting for the highest possible CC with her 🤷‍♂️"`-2.0`2020-09-11 18:01:58`138.0
Depends on how you wanna play. Take LV for example. If you run an ult rush team you want def hp for higher cc and survivability. Personally though, I run him with att crit dam. I'll often go second but with LV and Blue Arthur I can take down any unit I want first turn. With Lilia, it's a bit tricky. Although her heals and damage will be better, going second with a squishy support sounds counterintuitive.`-4.0`2020-09-11 20:07:31`138.0
Given that green escanor is no longer in every team, her survivability went up by a lot. I am in challenger too, and many times I lose a game cause her heal is useless (basically dead draws, worse even since they barely heal) or she can't break a lvl 1 merlin shield to drain. I agree with you, that until this point HP/DEF was the way to go, but I am seriously considering transitioning her especially for future Pve and well as PvP content. CC while will still matter, won't mean jack in the future when whales and casual spenders are going to out CC you anyway by buying cosmetic upgrade packs.`1.0`2020-09-13 05:35:35`138.0
I only use her gear for fights since I don’t do heard pvp, so I also do atk def. it’s better because it makes things go faster, and her heal is better but in pvp she would die too fast, but she would still do no damage`1.0`2020-09-11 19:26:48`138.0
That hp/def set on LV only works if you mega whaled and got him 6/6 tbh. Having him even at 3/6 will hit like a wet noodle`9.0`2020-09-11 20:13:11`138.0
But at future when that happens you won't be able to compete at that high level anyways and you will instead compete against people similar to you. And a few 1000 cc more you get from hp/def gear will in fact matter.`2.0`2020-09-13 06:01:15`138.0
Not at all. My LV is 3/6 and I've tried both sets. As long as he crits, he still claps everyone bar Red Escanor. Try running Deathpierce in the sub slot.`-1.0`2020-09-11 20:31:46`138.0
Not sure about this. The jp content creator I watch (actual japanese, so not nagato and his gang) still goes first with 230k+ cc using her like that. I think she can work and gain more utility with atk/def, but I see all your points, heck I've been using her with hp/def all this time myself so I agree with everything you said. Possibly when we get a more varied meta with more units to choose from that are actually viable, having to go second in a game won't be an instant loss as it pretty much is not on gbl`1.0`2020-09-13 06:08:33`138.0
Ah yes but see 230k + cc is pretty much whale territory. I don't think you can get there so easily as f2p with atk/def sets. That requires a lot of perfect rolls and cosmetics.`2.0`2020-09-13 06:20:38`138.0

"Hi, all! It's ya girl, HG211, here with this week's events. I'm sorry it's a little late. I actually had this ready right around reset but work's ♫ been kicking my butt all over town ♫ (to the tune of [No Diggity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KL9mRus19o)). Lots of stuff going on this week, including reduced stamina, and a bunch of Half Anni events. That means you can get $$$ for selling Fort Solgres books and then pull for gear, which has an SSR rate up for Half Anni, and then salvage it, which is also rate up! You can also run free stages for gear and salvage those. Just salvage everything you can, since salvage rate ups are the rarest.

The new step-up unit is Mono, who is meh, but has a cool buffed unique. You can also continue to try to pull LV Meli (and Fraudrin). New King Arthur is also still available. He is also just okay as a unit but his armor is cool. My Red Arthur has adopted it.

It was going pretty well until the vibraphone had to play low notes. I also started running out of space so I had to cut a lot out. With a lack of storage, no access to 32nd notes, and the vibraphone sounding like shit for low notes, this theme can’t be made properly`2.0`2020-09-11 05:50:01`144.0

says it ends 9/15. based on my own experience of spending 80m on the draw gacha...you're gonna need a solid couple of hours just to sort your inventory and continually rerun it haha. not something i would put off until the last minute...unless you have a 1000+ space inventory.`8.0`2020-09-11 00:19:21`145.0
It takes a rather long time to process some of it, and Gear Gacha rate ups, and Salvage rate up going away on the 15th, and you don't want to be managing that SSR gear and gold while the Half stam Solgres is going on.`2.0`2020-09-11 03:17:55`145.0
"you get Hammers at an increased rate from it, and Hammers are very valuable. additionally, the salvage event is going on too, so any SSR gear you get is basically double dipping once you salvage that.

it's a gold sink for folks like OP, who have 100m+ gold. if you're low on gold, there's not enough value there because 1 or 2 hammers is not going to help you. also, low amounts of gold is bad because of all the gold needed to level equipment, UR it, raise units, et cetera. 

i am going to guess that your account is somewhat new? if that is the case, low gold is perfectly reasonable and skipping this is the way to go. as your account gets older and your units more finalized, and your gear more finalized, you're going to be stockpiling a lot of the gold from half stamina Solgres. and then you become like OP, minus all the gold chest hoarding."`3.0`2020-09-11 00:29:24`145.0

Tbh, imo, we have quite a lot of OC's now, maybe just release another version of them, Blue Camilla, Green Mono, Red Shin, etc. After that we should  just continue with story characters for awhile as there are many that arent in the game, Sir Denzel, Greyroad, Waillo (?) etc. Not to shit on the OC's, I love them but we have enough without needing to make/add new ones`18.0`2020-09-11 07:19:22`149.0

" I don't think it would be a great idea at least not yet. The Disasters make sense since Lilia initiated it to take revenge on her master. 
As for the archangels they don't like to meddle with humans so it's quite unlikely for them to have OC Counters. 
For demons it's quite different. While they could easily be a way to introduce characters who wants to kill them, the whole reason  the 7DS were created was to fight the 10 commandments. So making OC better for that would be like trashing on the original ones."`1.0`2020-09-14 06:08:59`149.0

Op already confessed to have used a macro , either i like fact that they ban these ppl , though they could make it a bit soft and give a warning like a 4-5 day ban before a permanent ban`4.0`2020-09-12 06:34:44`155.0

u said u did use macro for enhancing gear... macros are prohibited by tos, so thats why u are banned.`3.0`2020-09-12 04:26:22`155.0

"Macros to enhance gear shouldn't be needed as the game should have that functionality. Also, NM would have to ban pretty much every end game account for it. Even the streamers are running them.  


I agree on the soft ban. It should always be a temp ban unless someone used an actual hack to win."`1.0`2020-09-13 04:03:09`155.0
they made an announce months ago where they said it's ok to run macros for that kind of stuff, you don't really need to use macros at all in this game, plus macros aren't that easy to detect, they said that it's ok to use blustack emulator long ago as well.`1.0`2020-09-13 10:56:18`155.0

?? They're achievements for diamonds, they don't have to be easier. What would be the point of achievements at all if they were so easy?? For grey demon use tanky characters on your team like Valenti and cheese it with resistance food or ult rush with Green Liz. And crimson you can almost solo with Derieri.

I recently beat these a couple days ago for the gems for LV banner. Grey is actually super easy and I don't have GKing. I beat it with GMerlin, GEsca, RGowther. Gesca is super bad here but I made it work. Howlex however is pretty hard and you need a lot of rng. I used RDeri, RGowther, RArthur but I had really good rng. Good luck.`2.0`2020-09-12 11:06:54`159.0
Seems like a you problem. I beat these when they first came out and guess what, it was tough just like it should be. You should be glad you have access to UR gear now since it makes so much easier.

Just git gut. the challenge will get 1 step further when hell demons release since they have a solo mission as well.

"Defence gives the most cc and reduces damage so is usually the best call. For some characters with very low base resistance(like gJericho), resistance will decrease their damage taken compared to defence at the sacrifice of some cc.
Overall, rolls on these two gears are low priority, you should reroll them last. Defence is usually preferable and is almost certainly the way to go if you want to Go first in geared PvP. Imo, a couple of resistance rolls isn't bad at all on most characters to save on anvils.
I personally (after rerolling all other pieces) tend to go for a high defence or resistance stat. If I had a surplus of anvils, I would go full defence."`2.0`2020-09-10 23:18:25`161.0

"You don't really have too many good units except for LV Meliodas, B King, R Howzer and B Arthur, so that should probably be your main team for now. 

R Howzer needs Pierce Substats on his gear and Arthur needs Crit Dmg, which makes both of them, not ideal for a beginner cause these sets are very specific and only used on a few characters each. R Howzer is usually only used for farming and sometimes in PvP while Blue Arthur is usually only used for Red Demon Deathmatches.

&#x200B;

I highly recommend getting Red Gowther as soon as possible cause he is useful for all content and maybe another DPS unit that's better in PvE than LV Meli, for example Green Escanor or even better Red Derieri.

You should also get Red Arthur for Gold Coins cause he's one of the best allrounder units with his buff and the ability to deal decent dmg while buffing the whole team significantly."`1.0`2020-09-11 09:09:53`161.0
Your question about the association really depends on who the units are. Some units just have much higher base stats naturally than others. I think typically the SR unit is going to be higher because of the extra 2% stats that it gives.`1.0`2020-09-11 08:40:35`161.0
"I went Master V to Champ last week using a 2/6 LVM, after being stuck in Masters for months. I might recommend switching Esconar for Gowther and putting Merlin in the sub slot, which I went for an 80% win rate with. Don’t underestimate how much Gowther’s attack seal can completely stop current meta teams. Eat ult food and then depending on if you go first or second, the goal should be as follows:

Going first, typically going to rank up Meli with Gowther to get his ult ready for turn 2, if the enemy has ult rollback (Lillia or Merlin mainly) then it depends on who got dealt an extra card, if it’s Meli then you can get his ult ready without Gowther’s rank up so the other two cards played should either be rank up Gowther attack seal, or rank up king petrify to stop the ult rollback, after that it’s usually gg with Meli’s ult. Alternatively if King or Gowther got dealt an extra card, move to combine and then rank up their respective CC card to prevent rollback and have their ult ready turn 2.


Going second isn’t bad either since with ult food you can typically have two ults ready to go by turn two and the enemy will have to choose who to try to stop, similar strategy as going first but with only needing two orbs for an ultimate you should be able to use a card combine and two attack skills to get two ults ready to go, which is usually enough to knock out their entire front line"`2.0`2020-09-11 07:47:58`161.0

"LV ist mostly used in PVP, should have known that beforehand people have said that over and over. There are some rare uses in PvE for him but most of that content like Tower of Trials isn't released yet.

"That's pretty much the standard team. I use Howzer instead of Escanor personally but Esca is more popular for sure. 

I feel like you're in a pretty good spot. Going first though is a big advantage when you're focusing on multi-target attacks so try to push the number up when you can. Maybe instead of pierce food you could go with something like HP if you need a little CC boost to consistently go first."`1.0`2020-09-11 08:36:23`161.0

"Well, use your silver coins and buy more pots. If you been farming Evil Lilia boss battle, then that just a waste of resources. Unless your whaling. 

If you don’t have silver coins, then add as many friends and buy pots with friend coins. With 39 friends, you get 800 for sending coins, then 200 for visiting friends traven, then some more for using friends via free stage/farming in the sub. You can get any thing from 1000-1600 friends coins depending on what you do. That be 200 coins per pots, so you can get between 5-8 pots plus your two from cooking, and one more for your daily summon if you get a silver coin. So in a day, you can get between 5 - 12ish pots per day.

The ult level only determines how much of the stats get transferred to the main unit. A one out of six unit transfers 5% of base stats. A six out of six unit transfers 10% of base stats. So having better more stats on your associations via level up/limit break and awakenings will absolutely increase your cc because they'll be giving more stats to the main unit.`2.0`2020-09-11 08:53:41`161.0

I've tested that with a friend cause I don't have RDM, we both had around 12.5k Atk on our DPS unit and RDM dealt around 100 - 110k with both of his 3\* Skill while Derieri dealt around 115 - 125k (no buffs) and 250 - 300k+ (lot's of buffs) with her 3\* Skill.

"Yea the SSR Def Bracer, but you'll need 1 more def item and 4 more Atk items to get both set bonuses.

Long story short, SSR pieces will always have the highest max main stat, but all qualities have the same max secondary stats.

The  real difference comes down to cost. Every time you want to reroll a  main stat, upgrade an item, or reroll a secondary stat, you have to  spend gold. The lower the quality, the cheaper the cost. Keep in mind  that you not only need to fully upgrade each equipment, you also need to  make sure that both the values and the secondary stats are the ones you  wanted.

When you are first starting  out, it is recommended to fill your right-hand slots, meaning Ring,  Earring, and Orb, with fully upgraded C quality gear. Their secondary  stats should be the same as their main stats. Meaning that for rings,  you want attack secondaries, for earrings you want defense, and for orbs  you want HP. In an ideal world, you end up with 15% of each. More  realistically, you probably end up with around 12% of each.

For  your left-hand slots, meaning Bracer, Neck, and Belt, you want to equip  0-star +5 SSR quality gear. Do not spend gems to reroll their main  stats. If you find another SSR piece with a higher main stat roll,  upgrade that one to +5 and use it. It only costs 15,000 gold to do it.

This  method allows you to power through content without investing a large  number of resources by relying on high percentage secondary stats. As  you progress deeper into the game and collect more resources, you can  slowly upgrade all your equipment into SSR pieces with good secondaries."`1.0`2020-09-11 02:00:03`161.0

One more thing I should add for your attackers(Green esca) getting attack and Def is essential for them and for your supports or healers (Red Gowther and Green liz) getting hp and Def good for them too.And if you are low on awakening materials you can try to farm from boss stages.A good farming team would be Blue giant diane hozwer red king and red gowther in the back. And if you are low on blue stones doing the free stages will get you gear that you can salvage(Always salvage sr gear). I believe that there gonna be an event coming soon that increases the success chance for blue stones(if comes it is called salvaging event and also +5 any extra SSR gear that you get to increase your of getting *5 stones).And lastly most of your substat should atk def and hp`2.0`2020-09-11 06:41:08`161.0

He actually meant that if we had better rates but less diamonds, the result would be the same. At least with more pulls, you have more chances to be lucky. I played several gacha, some of them have better rates but they give soooo low amount of currency that you won't be pulling even 20% of all characters. In Grand Cross it's actually possible to own like 95% characters while being f2p not just because of how many f2p diamonds they're giving out but also because of all other stuff as well, like free pulls, free tickets, etc. This current event alone gave us 5 different SSR characters for free. Show me any other generous game like that? And Grand Cross not even the most popular game out there.

rking makes pen teams useless. actually i have tested this team with my friend and you should replace merlin with gowther. rank up lillia first turn so you get a cleanse and an ult gauge removal. then slowly rush LV ult by ranking up his cards. if you are fighting pen, go for gesca first. he does damage even with low pierce rate. if you are fighting LV ult rush with bking, go for king first.`1.0`2020-09-11 04:52:48`165.0

"Just FYI, the default filter is sorted by piece/type/stat.

So if you have 30 attack bracers at the same awakening/enhancement, you only need to click the first few after whatever you already have locked (and lock the ones in between currently locked ones).

You can also just filter by substat (attack/def/HP), so same thing but you can do all types of bracelets at once, all types of belts at once, etc.

I mean, I totally would love a substat filter like there is on auto enhances (you set what you want on a bar) - and I hope we get it! – but you can achieve the same thing with the existing filters and a modicum of deductive reasoning."`3.0`2020-09-09 19:22:49`170.0

I mean I wouldn't say it's so bad. Although if they were to either make it easier to get gems or maybe reduce overall prices it would be better.

In my opinion this changes nothing. The skills would need to be unique to have an impact on the meta. For example if you can stat boost mono and lv meli you will just buff Meli and continue using him. It would be different if it were no stat boosts but skills/passives. Like the skill tree in games like World of Warcraft. On the other side this would be to complex. In most cases a Good option is to frequently release balance patches every few month to bring people to build different units.`8.0`2020-09-11 04:30:41`172.0

"Overall, I like the addition of some type of “skill point” system to create variability between mirror match units in PvP, etc. (IE, two LV melis with Attack/def sets are basically the same unit...)

I like the increase in base stats but not by that much and make it the same across the board for all rarities (IE, 5/5/10% max for each HP/attack/def, etc.) but in order to increase them, you’d need to grind those units up. Using the units more frequently in modes that require stamina would allow them to garner “skill points” by pure luck. The more you use a unit, the more skill points they can get in order to use to boost those base stats. However, they will NOT be able to max out all of the stats. For this example here, a unit would only be able to obtain 10 skill points max, which each can be used increase either the attack/HP by 1% or their defense by 2%. 

1. This still allows for variation between builds for the same units. IE, you can choose to split your skill points evenly between all three stats (IE, 3/4/4, 4/4/2, etc), or go all in on a couple stats (5/0/10, 5/5/0, etc).

2. This encourages you to use more units that you normally wouldn’t to increase their levels as well. Though it doesn’t necessarily make SR units on the same lvl as SSR since the base increase is the same across the board, that’s ok since increasing SR stats to the level of SSR defeats the purpose of having any sort of rarity at all. They’d just all be the same tier pretty much.


Edit: the CC system for points you described makes it far too p2w. You’d have to get UR gear for tons of off meta units to possibly hit it."`-1.0`2020-09-11 06:15:48`172.0
"This was my thinking too.

I like your point about the skills being unique. I wonder if a system like an ""associated passive"" would work - either boosting the stats of the existing passive, or unlocking a totally different one (or a combined-inspired one) only available when that associate unit is in place.

Could make it a different associate to their ult one as well so you have the option to choose and diversify more."`2.0`2020-09-11 05:05:15`172.0

 not that i disagree with your assessment; i play Pierce (but not at Champion) at 188k with Pierce rolls in geared and have not even UR'd BDM's attack gear and i still blow out LV teams without Red King.

"It's mostly because pierce users are starting to reroll the top pieces to ATK on their BDM gear (so it can be shared with LV in the future). I've done some testing and concluded that you barely need any pierce rolls to wipe an opponent that doesn't have RKing. 

For example, with ATK food (I have the 14% title) I can comfortably wipe my opponent despite having 0 pierce rolls on BDM, always guaranteeing a kill on anyone turn 1(in this case LV is always my priority if they're not using RKing), then wipe the next turn. 

You'd still need half pierce/half attack on Lilia though, and this will benefit her healing alot. I can also confidently run ATK/Crit DMG on BDM because I know my CC won't be hindered and I'll always be going first against someone not running HP/CC food. For reference I'm sitting at 205k without food with RKing sub, all UR gear except the middle pieces on everyone.

Also, I went hard on Lilia's banner because I knew I was going to main pierce for a while, thus I got her 4/6 and through LV's banner, got Escanor and BDM 6/6 and RKing 4/6. It's actually surprising how many pierce users I face are always +200k CC because they pulled all these dupes through time.

But yeah, long story short, people are too busy using ult food in this meta without RKing that pierce users will most likely go first and dominate."`3.0`2020-09-11 05:09:25`173.0

Thx for the info, that's where I sit. So looking like it may be a while til I can do anything since 800gems in so far doesn't lead me to want to go for cosmetics yet. Especially when I broke past f2p to pay a bit... But not going to throw hundreds on a game for this`1.0`2020-09-11 16:14:05`173.0

Don’t assume too much. It’s probably a one time thing, because evil lilia is kinda (not rly tho) a special unit and therefore they are doing this kinda banner. And honestly since I’m only pulling for festival banners (quit the game after bdm release and missed blue Lilia) a banner with only OC would not be that bad, cause the only one I got is the free green Lilia and I’m not gonna pull for Bad units since I’m f2p.

"From what i know, ppl go triple def only for scoring in normal and hard since those 2 modes are the hardest to score as boss die too easily. I dont think its possible to patience in extreme but it doesnt matter as much there.

For crit units ie bslater,gking,levi etc triple crit will always do more damage than atk/def however if you are using that unit for pvp you might consider going atk/def since it will give you more cc to start first."`3.0`2020-09-10 08:38:41`176.0
I’ve wondered about small green Diane having triple def`3.0`2020-09-10 09:11:22`176.0
"Triple def with max resistance rolls, you can even patience hard guild boss ultis.

Its probably best to UR gowther hp/def set with necklace and earring as def pieces, so you can swap them out.  (For normal n hard I use UR def necklace, earring, a C 0 star def ring for bracer and ring and some random SSR def belt and orbs.).

Guild boss is leaving this week so its not too important but it gives you that option in the future if we need it.

Crit dmg well it is nice but yeah lower cc, gking has super high crit chance with ulti, but if you were planning to run bking or rking, they would work better with hp/def sets.

Unless u plan to run winged king in the future with atk/def, I mean you could go with necklace and earring with crit dmg pieces non UR and the other pieces UR atk pieces.

Imo its pointless to make UR sets for raids unless u are a whale, your focus should be pvp and pve content like guild boss, final boss and the upcoming tower of trials."`3.0`2020-09-10 10:50:50`176.0

Even farming gear is way better than buying it from the shop (excluding pvp).

Like you I got frustrated at the Merlin dude. I kept mentioning Gustav's passive benefits the whole team which is 100% better than extra pierce rate on Merlin.

But Deldry doesn't hit hard enough. Best team is Blue king and Blue Giant Diane with the merlin sub. I haven't tried LV meli as a substitute for one of them yet just because he's only at ult level one and my Diane is maxed and my King is 4/6`1.0`2020-09-09 13:58:27`182.0

Don't do boss battles, do Fort Solgres book stage, and then sell the books, you can get 100m+ gold in 100ish + stam potions.`9.0`2020-09-10 12:28:22`183.0
I'm not sure about the one minute run, you have to account for loading times, I usually do it in around 1:30- 2:00 mins each run completely. Why are you doing boss battles for 100 million gold too?`3.0`2020-09-10 11:05:20`183.0
"It’s not half stamina, but running one of the disaster fights with a reliable farming team can net you a lot of chests, books to sell, 5★ awakening stones, 5★ chalices and gold itself. For example, here is one of my runs;

Edit: this was over a 10-11hr period in 1 day. I’m currently now at 69mil  
  
Edit 2: Sorry, i think I just saw one of your responses to someone else saying you’re on JP. This method I believe is only for Global right now. In this case, Fort book farming is your best option as others have suggested."`2.0`2020-09-10 13:58:35`183.0
Exactly. Not sure why op is thinking that's a good idea to farm.`2.0`2020-09-10 12:35:58`183.0
It's cuz there's the gear gacha rate up event coming tmrw on jp and wanted to farm most gold I can to splurge`1.0`2020-09-10 13:13:17`183.0
It's also cuz i need the chalices also`1.0`2020-09-10 13:13:59`183.0
"boss battles barely give you any gold that's why, so 100 million gold will require a bit too much time. 

Fort solgress and getting 100 million makes much more sense, and resonable within the half stamina time frame."`3.0`2020-09-10 13:43:28`183.0
For chalices, Deathmatches are better and they're free if you're invited.`2.0`2020-09-11 07:09:49`183.0
Basically both versions are the “same” from what I understand. It’s just that Global released quite a bit after JP. So that is why we are missing some characters and content, but from what I can tell, the Global version is moving very fast. So we don’t experience exactly what they experience when we get content. Things like different banners, different order of units, small nerfs or buffs to events, etc.`7.0`2020-09-10 14:52:26`184.0
"Japan doesn't have anything related to advertisements; instead they have a daily 1 diamond summon on the part 2 banner. Grand cross-exclusive characters have more limited costumes on the japanese version, with some available in the coin shop for platinum coins.                 


Global is starting a trend of buffing characters that underperformed on the japanese version on their release - monspeet ultimate and mono passive are different. I personally think there's a decent chance global will buff blue valenty and blue helbram."`2.0`2020-09-10 15:16:33`184.0

No you have to be top 100 in elite pvp, so it's only for the most top of players.`3.0`2020-09-10 17:24:46`184.0
"you have to be in gold 5 ungeared to be able to participate in geared pvp. then from gold 5 geared you have to climb to challenger(gold 5-1 then plat 5-1 master 5-1 champion 5-1 and then challenger) and reach top 100. In top 100 pvp you can do 100battles a week and the final points you end with give you season points. not entirely sure how the points scale, but you get some when you're not in top 100 as well. top 100 people at the end of the season(3 or 4 weeks) got blue helbram. rank 1 got him 6x rank 2 5x rank 3 4x top 10 3x i think and then top 50 2x top 100 1x. something like that.

"Thanks for the answer :)

And to clearify it a bit, also for u/loli-breaker

Yes, no question is unanswered in the megathread, but often, questions that need a bit more perspective are simply answered with one word or very subjectiv opinion.

Quick example:

Somone asked if it is worth it to farm boss stages on half stamina.

The first answer was a simple ""no""

Which is not correct.

Boss Stages give Awakening Materials, Chalices and SSR Orbs. It is never not worth farming them. Only if you have evrything 6\* awakened maybe or if you have no stamina pots left.

I gave a second answer and often there are more opinions as well to one question but sometimes the people don´t even try to give a good answer

Maybe I am a bit to harsh, but thinking about new players, that know nothing about the game, are mislead"`1.0`2020-09-10 18:12:55`185.0
"While I **100% agree with you** about some responders giving lacking answers, I still see a lot of the questions being asked in the megathread that are already answered in the FAQs.

To take your example, I just pulled this from the General FAQ ""Farming"" section:

>Boss Battle stages during Stamina Decrease Events are your best bet at farming for chalices and SSR runes  
>  
>Some Awakening materials can only be farmed on Hard or above, so double check the drops before you start

As you might be able to tell, a lot of the recent changes were made to help better highlight where these FAQs are e.g direct messaging them to new members, links in the sidebar/menu/question megathread etc so they are getting more detailed answers that have already been recommended by the community.

Kingbram can get you to masters 5. But not much further. Mono red doesn't need to go first.`2.0`2020-09-10 08:49:22`188.0
Ult rush works ok going second, with LVMeli or gEsconar you can sometimes get two ultimates ready by turn two, due to their silver attack ability granting an extra ult orb, and you can use bKing or bLillia to stall or roll back Ults allowing you to get yours off first if the opponent is ult rushing too. Alternatively, mono red is a pretty high CC team naturally and you can eat CC food instead of Ult food which may get you enough to go first`1.0`2020-09-10 10:07:58`188.0
Kingbram can easily win matchups going second even without using any PvP foods. Although it requires atleast 4/6 ult levels for the 3 of them, Gowther, King and Helbram. Otherwise even if you lock them for long, your ult damage wouldn't suffice.`1.0`2020-09-10 14:57:10`188.0

Both are great but Gowther is definitely most people's choice as the better here`5.0`2020-09-10 08:54:00`188.0
I looked at my Affection levels. My Merlin has 40% more affection than Gowther. For PvE GMerlin is a hard hitting character with ult orb removal and the AI plays all their skills well. Gowther is better in theory but the AI mistimes playing rank ups and attack disables, so actually is a poor choice for most farming. I would get both but perhaps Gowther should be first, as there are some tricky PvE battles that are hard without rank ups.`1.0`2020-09-10 11:21:07`188.0
I’d say wait for Gowther. He’s a must have character that can be used in any game mode (pvp, pve, raids), on any team. His rank up ability is unique to him and him only, while merlin’s skills are replaceable by other characters. Merlin has a better passive, but is uniquely used for ult rush pvp teams. Strictly for PVE, Gowther could be weaker if you don’t have any other strong characters since Gowther is utility/support. But if your other characters are decent, Gowther would be the better pick`1.0`2020-09-10 12:45:40`188.0

go for attack/crit. critical damage scales of attack, with only his affinity sword LV have 187.5% critical damage so to make things simple; assume LV is attacking a 0 stats target, if his base attack is 10k his crit will be 18.75k. now with attack crit set (not counting the set attack stats just percentage) his normal attack will hit for 12k and his critical will hit for 12x207.5%= 24.8k. now with 3xcrit set his normal attacks will hit for 10k and his critical will hit for 10x247.5%= 24.75. with attack/crit he will deal more damage on his normal attacks and he will do much better against enemies with high critical resistance and critical defence such as gowther, escanor and late game bosses.

Fraudrin is a Whale Unit that has to maxed out to be useful at all and even then he's only used in PvP.

Red Kung Fu Diane is pretty much useless cause there is no reason to use her anywhere, she doesn't escell at anything and is good at nothing. Most Diane's aren't that great the only exceptions being Blue Giant Diane who's decent in PvP and Green Small Diane who's very useful in some niche cases.

Blue Mage Merlin is the worst Merlin in the game and isn't used anywhere for the same reason that diane isn't used anywhere, she's not good at anything.

Blue Gowther is a bit underrated for PvP, but there is no reason to ever use him because he is bad in PvE and Red Gowther is amazing in all Content including PvP.

Blue Hendrickson is THE WORST SSR UNIT in the whole game, because he has no initial Pierce Rate or Resistance which are two of the most important secondary stats. He also has no Regeneration Rate. He has a Lifesteal Ult and a Lifesteal Card both of which are trash because lifesteal cards in general aren't good at all. He has an Ignite card which is decent but that doesn't even matter because again 0% Pierce or Resistance. His Passive is completly useless cause nobody ever needs recovery rate..

You're only looking at the Amplify. But you have to keep in mind that Arthur buff gives +30% attack to all dps, which is insane on high multiplier cards(Deri ult, rEscanor ult). Furthermore all your characters get 30% defense, 30% hp and debuff immunity. This makes your run way safer and allows for turn stalling if you get bad card rng. Arthurs ult can also deal good damage, because it basically always crits, which makes him worth at least 1/2 dps.`2.0`2020-09-10 05:27:48`188.0
You answered yourself, deri only buff herself, and you will need the survivability arthur provides to the whole team, obviously if you dont need survivability arthur doesnt make sense, if you can do without his buff then you can bring another dpser.`1.0`2020-09-10 05:29:12`188.0
"Derieri buffs a lot, but other DPS units like Red Escanor and RDM don't, so it's always useful to have at least one Arthur to buff everyone and increase all their base stats by 30% as well as giving debuff immunity.

"This is exactly what I was thinking. RArthur does boost REscanor but doesn't add much to Derieri (debuff immunity at lv 3).

I don’t really agree with that advice, to my knowledge I don’t think any exchange has ever returned using the same currency as the last time around.. and even if it did I don’t think that would justify holding on to all those extra slots for so long.

Rotating through the hard village gear quests really boosts the number of SSR gears you farm. Those guaranteed gears every 8 clears is a 12.5% SSR drop rate, to add to the base 3% per chest dropped, usually 2-4 per clear so 6-12%. So more than twice as many farmed for the same stamina used.

oh my bad, I totally misread your post, for levi specifically 6xcritical might be just as good or even better because his card deals spike (2x critical damage) and his criticals are guaranteed, so you can  calculate his damage as if his attack=his critical damage.

"Nope, you're right.

He's on Coin Shop Banners sometimes, but these are very rare. Coin Shop units can usually only be bought in the Coin Shop.

He's definatly worth it tho, his first skill can seal the attack of all enemies which is always useful to prevent some attack unless the enemy is debuff immune or can cleanse.

His second skill is the reason he's not just good but extremly good in any content, it allows you to rank up the skills of allies which takes a lot of randomness out of the fights, you're going to have many more 2 and 3* cards this way.

His Ult is very useful because it can drain 3 or with king as an association 5 ult gauge from all enemies preventing their ults, it doesn't deal as much dmg as a Blue King Ult, but it deals decent damage.

His Passive is also really good giving extra dmg for all allies each turn he doesn't get hit, which can be forced very easiely with his atk seal card or a unit with taunt. In PvE it can also be forced by having a unit with less HP in the group, cause AI usually goes for lowest HP first, he usually has HP/Def gear so you'll likely get this just by having a unit with Atk/Def Gear in your team."`1.0`2020-09-12 00:57:15`188.0

Because this subs will complain everything. Look at the first week the jukebox release. Some stupid people complain because there are too much people posting their music.

"Mono would be great if her two cards did Bleed and Poison respectively and her Ult was Weak Point or Ruin. That way she wouldn’t be dependent on 2 other characters to make full use of her passive. Also her poison apples AFTER the attack so she doesn’t gain the 50% damage after her first cards which hurts her a lot.

Now if she had Bleed on one card and Poison on the other you could Poison and then Bleed for 50% extra damage and bleed damage which would be great. It would also make her more reliable at keeping her passive active."`1.0`2020-09-09 05:25:50`193.0

"I've been trying out a handful of Festival King and Demon Hendrickson teams on JP, and I'm fairly confident that Mono won't be ""super necessary"" for their team when they arrive on Global.

She would give the team a nice amount of single-target burst damage from the second turn onward, but I suspect that LV and GLiz will remain better overall options. 

If you're wanting to pull her regardless, she's almost certainly going to appear on all future OC banners, and there are quite a few that are coming out between now and Festival King's release (assuming Global's release schedule is similar to JP's). G. Eastin's banner and Shin's banner are both worth summoning on, so I'd suggest saving gems for those banners and hoping that you pull her on them."`4.0`2020-09-09 05:09:37`193.0

"I may be the only one on this sub that actually likes his commandment. It works well with his counter/leech build. He gains immunity to debuffs when initiating countering meanwhile his enemies get weaker. It certainly can affect allies but if you are using gowther, well he isn't there for dmg and neither is blue king. I primarily use bk for his cc more so than dmg since Estarosa deals out more than enough dmg when his counter is gold. Once he gets his ult it's a free extra turn, which makes a big difference both in PvE and PvP. That said, it certainly has negatives. Enemies unaffected by debuffs just become a slightly bigger pain in the arse since you take them on while they don't. There are also a lot of characters that can counter his bread and butter but outside of those instances I enjoy it. I've always been for a more ""stop hitting yourself"" approach and Estarosa definitely fills that role very nicely."`1.0`2020-09-09 04:35:52`196.0

I’ve beaten Ult rush teams with good RNG & first turns but yeah that fact that King can purify his whole team & literally immobilize a character with a level 2 card is why I dislike him.

There's 51800 people on this subreddit. People get hyped when they pull something good, and want to share it iwth others who also feel the same way. Not everyone in the entire world share the exact same opinion as them. Does that mean that just because a few people supported slavery that it was the wrong decision to end it? Bragging can be intentional and unintentional, doesn't mean you intentionally pour salt on them saying you didn't get it so others can feel sorry for you.`1.0`2020-09-09 01:44:57`196.0

Another thought is some people climbed to champ first month the game came out when It wasnt nearly as competitive as it is now.

I climb to champ 1 ungeared every week and challenger elite every week since the first week the game launched.

Definitely go for Meliodas banner since that one has more value. More than half of Mono's banner are coin shop units that you can get anytime so you're only pulling for the Disaster units like Mono and her group`7.0`2020-09-08 22:49:23`199.0
LV Meli banner is the best one to summon out of all the available ones,  but be mindful that having LV Meli at 1/6 ulti is very underwhelming, both PvE & PvP. Manage your expectations, he is not godly when u only have a single copy of him.`3.0`2020-09-09 05:39:12`199.0

"When have they ever done that? The one time they fucked up a unit's skill description(shin) they refunded everyone all the gems they paid. When they messed up valenti's banner description they refunded everyone the gems that they were supposed to pay. Dafuq are you on about.

"Whales will pull anyway and f2p cannot afford. So no, your logic is flawed. No one in their right mind will pull niche units, when LV meli banner is up. That's why they do those single step-up filler banners now.

I mean I pulled on both banners, and I only bought a weekly sub bundle, if you have luck or haven't wasted all of your gem reserves then you can do it, not sure it's worth it though.`1.0`2020-09-08 21:22:33`199.0
