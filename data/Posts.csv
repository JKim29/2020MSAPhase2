|New Head Mod| + |Moderator Applications are Open!|^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/ish649/new_head_mod_moderator_applications_are_open/^"##Following the recent departure of a great moderator, a change has been made to seek stabilization in the subreddit: I am stepping up as the new head of Reddit and filling the void Bucks has left. 

&nbsp;

##In my relatively short time here, I feel like I've brought some control to the chaos and helped harbor a less toxic environment for us all to enjoy our mutual love of this game. That said, I'm not yet satisfied. 

&nbsp;

##This sub stagnates, where I feel it could be even greater with a bit more help. With a bit of help, we could create a much more helpful and interesting community, with better guides and even fun organized events for members here!

Ok Netmarble, let's talk about the biggest QOL we NEED since ever, but now more than ever.^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/ittr4e/ok_netmarble_lets_talk_about_the_biggest_qol_we/^"Let's start with this: this game has a lot of pros and cons, which are usually subjective for each kind of player. But there has been one defect in particular which, i think, is the biggest one and shared among 90% of the players in SDS.

This defect is the missing GEAR PRESET system.

For the ones who don't know what's this: a gear preset is a memorized set of specific gear pieces, among the ones in your inventory. In particular each gear piece can be in more presets at the same time. When a player calls a preset for the character, those gear pieces are automatically removed from the other characters and equipped. JUST 1 click.

This feature could be further improved making preset for an entire team (for example a red demon team's preset).

With the last update actually we have: the event boss, 3 hell demons and the elite pvp. These require different teams and optimized gears for each one, including associations.

This situation is becoming annoying for a lot of players and can make us quit. I hope somehow this message reaches netmarble if you guys agree with me.

gKing and hell grey demon^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/itmwrg/gking_and_hell_grey_demon/^"Hi guys,

due to the new patch with the addition of hell demon mode, there are some unclear factors regarding king.

I want to ask and verify in this post, so others all players could learn and play efficiently. 

I equipped my king with 6x cdm gear with atk substat rolls and he could one-shot grey demon on extreme for 450k with lvl3 S1 and gGilthunder as buffer (ofc with Gowther MVP). I thought I was right on equipping him with this gear. The gear was only R though.

Now on extreme I patience grey with full orb with lvl1 s1. It doesn't make sense. I even have Deathpierce as sub now and it doesn't help.

I've read on the other post, that 4x atk + 2x cdm with cdm substat rolls is better. But I'm pretty sure it won't help, even when I'm changing my gear like mentioned above.

My stats:
Lvl 80
Awakend 6x
5/6 ult level
Atk: 7963
Cdm: 230%

Remember, since I only played for 2 months so far, I can't change gear or upgrade gear to ssr for ""just"" grey demon.

So even if I change to 4x atk and 2x cdm with cdm substat rolls. It would be like this:

Atk: 7519
Cdm: 240%

So, why is it better than my set up?

Please enlighten all the players who struggle with grey demon. 

How is it on JP server?"^11^2020-09-16 14:23:59^28

And so when NY and Valentines comes around with new seasonal units they plan to give them to global at the same time that JP gets them. And going forth we will be getting the same exact updates as JP.

In other words, they were getting these seasonal units out of the way because we'll be getting the new ones that JP will get at the same time."^7^2020-09-16 14:11:33^32

Are valentine's costumes more important than Lost Vayne?^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/itmvfp/are_valentines_costumes_more_important_than_lost/^"In my opinion, long term waiting for this banner was the smartest decision I planned on skipping LV banner long time ago. 


Many people are realizing hell drops are scarce and really hard to get and even having a raid partner, materials are too many for what you get in drops. The f2p I know complain about this already in my opinion it's a very important banner that will help indirectly to the progression of any account this will even affect people that play after the banner leaves. 


Meanwhile Lost Vayne will be in the meta but he can be countered and eventually out of the meta specially faster rnow that we know global is rushing content, doesn't mean I say he's bad but the benefits valentines bring are bigger"^6^2020-09-16 14:21:33^35

What do you guys think about metas in general^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/itsnw0/what_do_you_guys_think_about_metas_in_general/^Okay, so metas are not uncommon nowadays with pvp genre in general. It's easy to play, it gives you high win chance. I used to play duel links and the metas are explicit in that game, I did try running meta comps for a while and gotta admit, very efficient, high win rate, but the thing is, just like game hacking and stuff, it gets boring after a while. What's fun is in it knowing you are going to win (unless you run into same comps who happens to have better rng of course). Now, I don't say that metas are necessarily bad but it just kinda takes away the fun. On the other hand, you are unlikely to win if you try running your own creative team, this, I think is what frustrates people and causes them resort to meta comps.

They hit us right where it hurts. Normal Arena^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/it7igo/they_hit_us_right_where_it_hurts_normal_arena/^"I might be complety wrong since I dont know much about cosmetic upgrades but if I understood everything right then these costum are crazy valueable in the long term and that we are fricked in normal arena

I will be disregarding the different types of demons since it should be somewhat even out after a certain period of time.

You need 30 of these new items to max one UR cosmetic and you get 1 per Hell demon and thats only when you are the party leader meaning you only get 6 a day max.

Characters like king gowther merlin etc do normaly have 15 UR costmetics. That would mean each will be needing 450 cosmetic upgrade items(15\*30)  with 6 a day that would mean you need freaking 75 days just to max out one Unit.

I have heard that they will get generous with these with events and such. BUT COME ON. The difference is way too big, not only will costums allow you to get 12 a day which is already twice as fast as not having the costume meaning it would only take 38 days to fully max one unit but you could also just finish a unit in one week if you wanted to since with the costums you can get cosmetic upgrades as a guest as well

I was realy hoping for these Hell demons to be a way for f2p to improve with crazy grinding.No hate towards p2w or anything but I mean they can already buy the items in the shop why are we f2p not at least allowed to grind like crazy for them. Like I dont give a frick about the choose which demon comes shit but the effect of the 3 lolis is just too broken"^11^2020-09-16 00:11:44^49

Since we got the following exchange (2 dupes for 1 new), we might get similar one in future, when new year and valentines day 2.0 come with new characters. 

The dupes that you currently have (I got 2 Elaines, 1 gMeli and 2 Jennas) might be exchangable for absolutely new characters that will be coming out later.

Once again, it's just speculation, but if you  are not in a hurry to increase their ult damage, I think we better save them just in case."^8^2020-09-15 23:13:17^55

I hope y'all are praising the Sun God and getting blessed with many copies of LV. I'm writing this because I don't know if someone is in the same the position, and it may help them. I got seriously addicted to the game, and I haven't missed one single login since the RGowther/BGalland Banner. Talking to a very special person to me I realized how much time I've dedicated to the game, to the point I reached 192k team and 2M box, but I've suffered from my performance in both my work and social life. I barely interact with my family or talk with friends on social media anymore and I have been falling asleep until 2AM waiting for the next day reward to get a ""step ahead"" of everyone else. My job starts at 7AM and it really fucks up my schedule. The game is very fun, but lately I felt like I was completing the dailies just to not lose the gems, and it feels more like a job than fun. I'll leave so I can put my life on good tracks again. If you are suffering from this too, consider taking a break or leaving. If the game is no longer fun, don't play the game. I'll focus on my life, family and friends from now on, and play games for fun.

If you're leaving this because you realized you fucked up, don't regret the time you played because it was fun and you got entertained. If you continue to play, may RNGesus bless your pulls always.

A short while after I started the game I posted this. https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/gs0l1o/rate_my_wallpaper/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share and shit became a self-fulfilling prophecy.

What’s y’all problem?^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/it23bq/whats_yall_problem/^"Everyone on this subreddit is angry at Netmarble for rushing units. And to be fair, most of the time it’s understandable why y’all are annoyed.

However, why are you all getting annoyed at Netmarble for dropping so many good characters right now? You all do understand that it’s a celebration right? It wouldn’t be very nice if they dropped some shitty characters like Bellion during this major celebration.

I understand that it’s hard for F2P’s to keep up but even if it was easier to get gems it’s still just a game of luck. Even people who spend tons of money could get nothing. So I think it’s fair that everyone has the same chance of drawing the characters.

My point is, cut Netmarble some slack okay? At any other time I’m fine with y’all being upset at it but this a huge celebration so I feel likes it’s fair for them to release good characters."^0^2020-09-15 16:55:07^84

On the other hand, I think the true god tier, always number one unit is the great and glorious champion Taizoo. Here is a man who stood against holy knights with no fear in his heart. Who took up the Mantle of hero to protect the children of Vaizel when the holy knights attempted to ravage the town. A man driven forward by a dream to be the greatest fighter in Britainnia.

Am I the only one that's upset about the Valentine Units dropping so soon?^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/irzitt/am_i_the_only_one_thats_upset_about_the_valentine/^"We have been watching Youtubers talking about saving up 900 gems for LV and many people whaled out or saved up for that. He has been the most hyped up unit, next to Escanor.   


BEST UNIT IN THE GAME!   LV DESTROYS PVP!   OMGWTF LV OP!  


 Some are still hoping to pull him with the free gems that they may receive for the rest of this month.   


From what I gather, there are 3 Units who control what demon you spawn and 3 Units that give you a +1 guaranteed drop item.   


Not only do you need to pull the 6 units, but you are expected to purchase the cosmetics within that time frame. It will cost 150 gems for the ""+1 Drop"" units if you have all 3 of them and assuming the ""Trigger"" units work the same way, you need to set aside 300 gems at least just to buy cosmetics, otherwise you will be unable to get the special effect of the units and you will have wasted your time and gems.  


The release date is harsh. Dropping such an important Quality of Life improvement in a banner and forcing people to buy the cosmetics DURING the Lost Vayne Banner event, and knowing that Zeldris is around the corner, along with the Eastin Step Up Banner that will require 242 gems at minimum, how are people even expected to stash 300+ gems aside to buy cosmetics and maintain to pull these QoL units that this game needs?  


A way to fix this is to give the cosmetics away in the exchange shop for raid materials, maybe put a hawk pass with the Trigger Units and put the +1 units in their own STEP UP banners ( 242 Gems)  so that people can select which units and raid materials they want the most. ( Headpiece, Weapon, Armor)  


Whales and Dolphins (such as myself)  obviously don't care, but this is really harsh on the rest of the players. I won't lie, I feel really bad for them.   


UR will cost 30 Materials | SSR will cost 90 Materials | SR will cost 140 materials

Based off of Sekapoko's amazing maths, a person with no special units doing his own raids has a monthly income of 390 Materials. That's barely going to fully max out 1 unit with 5/5/5 UR cosmetics per month.   


I am even tempted myself to just skip this banner and deal with it, because I fear that I might have to go in too deep just to even get the units myself.   


Anyone else feeling like this is a little too brutal as well?"^43^2020-09-14 02:47:56^86
Just in need of a bit of guidance here.^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/is7ydh/just_in_need_of_a_bit_of_guidance_here/^"So, I've been saving gems like crazy for awhile. I mostly pull on banners just because I like the character. I do play PVP, but mostly just for the daily quests, not serious about it, and have never ended up above silver 2.  

I would really like red derieri, and I know eastin and glox are soon to come.

I have 915 gems right now and my roommate really seems to think I should pull for LV. He says that the likelihood of me not getting him before 900 is slim. However, I'm worried that if I get to 200 or 300 gems and DONT pull him, I won't want to go all the way to 900, and then I've just wasted those 200 or 300 that I could've used later for characters that haven't been released yet.

All in all, I'm just wondering whether LV is worth pulling for if I'm not big on PVP. I'm trying my hardest to play the storyline, and I've just now gotten stuck at episode 151.

Thank you in advance for any insight you can offer me!"^7^2020-09-14 10:11:18^87
GG;PO r/SDSGrandCross^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/irmxp8/ggpo_rsdsgrandcross/^"Hey folks,

This is the third draft of this, so let's hope third time's the charm.

I'm resigning from my position at r/SDSGrandCross (which I'm sure some of you will be happy about).

I've written two very lengthy versions of this post already, but I'll try to keep this one short and sweet.

Bucks quietly resigned from Reddit moderation on August 30th and Babben stepped in a few days later announcing they were ""taking stead as owner"". Babben has had zero input into the moderation and development of this sub.

Furthermore, with the exception of two other mods approving/removing a few links from the modqueue every couple of days, Waethrman and I have been the only active mods. We are also the only ones who developed [any of the current changes over the past month](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/ipb5og/subreddit_changelog_090920/) that has brought the sub to the standard it is in now.

Yesterday, Babben posted [a guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/iqyewq/seven_deadly_sins_grand_cross_beginners_guide_by/) to the sub misrepresented as ""by the staff team"" despite none of the Reddit mod team having even seen it, let alone contributed to it, before it went live. They then messaged us to ""pin this to the top or something"". I refused to for the reasons stated above.

I later found out that this guide Babben claims to have ""spent like 2h typing"" was in fact created by Discord team member Nightfall, who then spent two and half hours after Babben had posted it to Reddit helping them to fix all the errors Babben had managed to add. When Nightfall asked for writing credit on the Reddit post, Babben responded with ""I credited in the headline"". They clearly did not.

Babben also took steps yesterday regarding an email interview with Netmarble involving the subreddit that I do not feel best represented the sub; but did highlight to me their thoughts and feelings around it and their stance as ""owner"". 

I wrote a very lengthy resignation on the staff Discord that I won't share here unless absolutely necessary. However, based on what Babben said initially and in response to it I will say that:

* I do not feel they have any active interest in developing the subreddit
* They don't consider the ""owner"" as ""someone who runs the subreddit""
* I do not feel they value the input of the mod teams when it comes to external representation
* They recognise their poor behaviour but continue to do it anyway/make no actionable effort to remedy it
* They are adamant but misinformed about this sub being the one and the same community as the Discord (our latest stats indicate only about 30% of you are on both)
* I do feel strongly that they should not be seen as a person who represents this sub

As such I can't see a future where we can work together.

I want to end on a positive as I don't like writing posts like this, but I felt it was only fair to the sub community to announce and explain the reasons for my upcoming absence.

Waethrman is an absolute goddamn hero for the work they do here and it's been a pleasure working with them to get the sub to the current position it's in. It's weird to think that our first encounter was you misspelling my username :P

I never wanted to be a mod and was happy to just write and sticky my FAQs and PSAs. I only fell into it because Waethrman was the only one who ever showed an interest in developing the sub and I wanted to help. I'm really proud of what we put together here over the past month and I hope that they get the support that they deserve.

May RNGesus forever bless your banner pulls.

For the love of Twigod, please use the search function before posting.

RIP PSAs.

Red Gowther in daily new player thing?^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/is6pte/red_gowther_in_daily_new_player_thing/^"Hi.

I just started this game a couple days ago and after watching some videos and getting some experience with the game I’ve figured out red gowther is really good. 

When you check in with Elizabeth everyday there is one reward chart with red gowther in it and I wanted to confirm this chart won’t disappear once the half anniv. stuff is over. 

There isn’t a time left thing anywhere but I don’t want to be like 20 days into that chart only to get cucked by an expiry. I’ll attach a screenshot of it too. 

Also, *new player* lol. I’m a bit overwhelmed with all the half anniv stuff happening rn so any tips or suggestions would be great. 

Thanks in advance!"^2^2020-09-14 09:03:25^95

State of the game and pointlessness of spending money. Sort of^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/irgz95/state_of_the_game_and_pointlessness_of_spending/^"  Hello everyone, I’m glad you came to hear what I have to say. This post will be long, too long maybe, but I’ve always had trouble with getting straight to the point. If you’re here just for the memes and weekly patch notes that’s fine. Thanks for stopping by and good luck on your journey. For everyone else, stick with me any you might just find a way to waste half of an hour of your life instead being productive.

Let’s start with short introduction: I play since launch and I’ve spent over 1000$ over that time. That’s it, wasn’t so bad, was it. The thing is that’s all what’s needed to somehow justify what I’m going to say below, but 1st let’s commit one of the cardinal sins of writing and establish, what this post is **NOT** about:

· It’s not a good bye letter. No one cares about those anyway. If you want to leave just do it without pretending like some random ppl from reddit will miss you or even notice.

· I’m not exposing anything. There’s no secret reveal at the end, no one at NM is going to lose their job because of what I’m going to say here. All the info is out there, most if all points have been stated in one post or another.

· No hard data and evidences. Sorry math folks, no charts and pivots for you to glare at. If I’m ever going to give a number here it’s going to be a rough estimate which might even be entirely wrong. No market research was performed and no accountants harmed during writing of this post.

· There’s no judgment posed on anyone. Whether you’re casual F2P or hardcore whale with spare phone grinding the game 24/7. Whether you’re meta slave with your own excel sheets and efficiency charts, having mapped your decisions 2 months ahead, or you’re just logging 3 times a week to maybe get a character that you liked in anime. Everyone is welcome here and there’s no wrong way to play this game. Of course people still trying to make kingbram work are incorrect and should purge their game data immediately.

· There’s no need to argue who’s right or wrong here. I’m going to state my PoV here and I’m sure many will have different perspectives. I’m not trying to change other’s minds and I’m not looking to have mine changed. If you want to state your point please do so in comments below or in a separate post and let’s exchange ideas instead of arriving to one and only universal truth.

I hope now we’re on the same page, so let’s begin.

**Why are we spending money?**

So as I stated below I’ve spent some money here. “Some” is a huge understatement honestly because that’s the most I’ve ever spent on a single game ever. For me it was never about “supporting the developers”. I personally don’t believe in that statement and I think that the was majority of money goes into pockets of CEO and shareholders while actual developers are paid standard market wages. Might be wrong, but that’s beside the point. I spend money to get the “stuff”. It can be unit that’s strong, it can be a unit that simply looks cool or is unique, it can be cosmetics (even for units I don’t use, hello Diane!), it can finally be more indirect “stuff” like getting to higher league of pvp. I pay to get things I wouldn’t otherwise get or to save time grinding. I feel like that’s the most common reason to spend money in games, but I might be entirely wrong. That reason is also highlighted by the way game limits the accessibility of those things. Some units are limited, cosmetics can only be bought for $ for 2 weeks before they’re available for gems. Units have their banners weeks before they’re being added to the coin shop. 

And here we’re coming to the 1st problem with spending money. There’s a lot of things that aren’t guaranteed. You may want to get the new powerful unit that’s now on the banner, but with 0.5% chance you might get it within 10 pulls, or not get it in 1000. Sure, we have some step up banners or current LV one, but those are exceptions from the norm. Every pull has the same chance of giving you desired result so there’s no reason to think that with 200 pulls you’ll get 1/200 result. Probability is cruel in that regard and in the infinite universe we’ll find equal amount of players getting every single unit within 1st 3 gem pull as the amount of players rolling since the game launched and not getting single SSR unit beside random guarantees. Of course this is exaggeration, but it’s there to illustrate the point, that ultimately the amount of money you’re going to spend doesn’t matter. The reality is, if you’re not a massive whale who has no limits, then you’re spinning the same roulette as every other player. You get more chances, but logically there’s no reason to think they will change the final outcome. 

**It’s gacha, that’s how it’s supposed to be**

Maybe, maybe not. Remember that gacha is just one of the elements of the game we’re playing. We don’t log in just to pull the unit and then close the game until the next banner arrives. Well, maybe some of us do, what do I know, however I’d bet my broken watch and half-eaten bag of chips that most of the players do a lot more in the game itself. We play against others in arena, we compete in super bosses and other events, some mad lads might even read the story. All of this doesn’t need the gacha to function. You can also have the gacha game that has much better odds of the good outcome than 0.5% or 0.28%. Gacha can even work in a system without microtransactions, why not? I’d even argue that gacha with guaranteed “pity” result at the end is still gacha. Show me the person who plays gacha to roll and lose every time, I’ll wait (no doubt there’s someone out there, I’d like to meet you). You can still have the thrill of spinning the wheel knowing that worst case, you just have to spin in 100 more times to get what you need. It’s not like game publisher will lose something every time a player gets featured unit.

**Pace we’ve been moving so far and what lies ahead**

The uncertainty of getting the units is just one thing. We’re getting better and better units at a crazy pace and despite promises from developers (like those were ever meant to be fulfilled) we’re not slowing down. Not long ago we had the most hyped PvE unit in the game, Derieri, quickly followed by arguably the most hyped PvP unit in the game, LV. Now we’re getting leaks that limited holiday units are coming soon. Not 1, not 2, 6 brand new units that are getting their banner(s) and after that we won’t know if they will be obtainable in the future. For me it’s a massive slap in the face. I like collecting, even for the completing purpose alone. That’s why I got all Slime units, that’s why I pulled to get all AoT units. Now after extremely resource (aka money) draining banner we’re getting a limited one, with a ton of new units. It’s not only that, those units have limited cosmetics (even more investment) that are arguably, more important to F2P players. Cosmetic upgrades are another massive grind that will come with hell raids and people who would benefit the most from getting extra materials from raids won’t be able to do so in most cases. This is the prime example of rich get richer and poor get poorer. Despite the promises, the speed at which we’re getting through content (read new units) seems to be increasing with each week. Getting a great unit and maxing it out also isn’t good enough anymore. We can’t have players be happy with what they have for more than a week, can we? So here come pvp rules, so now even mediocre units can be top dogs for that week, coincidentally those units happen to be featured on the banner the same week. Quickly buy also the cosmetics packs because that unit will be absolute trash when they’re finally available for gems.

**Ok, but we’ll finally slow down, right? We have to**

I’ve lost my hopes for that. If releasing better and better units is forcing people to spend more money, why on earth would NM stop doing so? What’s the argument for giving the player-base room to breathe? Releasing patch notes just before the new unit arrives, conducting witch hunt on data-miners? Wasn’t it done purely to limit player information and increase the frequency of situations where we’re caught by surprise and face the dilemma – spend money or not get what we want and be punished by it? Uninformed players make poor decisions and those result in more money spent. 

If you’ve been looking at JP server you can clearly see that their approach also changed over past months. Following global server’s lead they now have final bosses releasing together with units designed to be used for the best scores. Oh, and instead of 242 gems step up let’s put 2 units on the same one with clearly the better one being guaranteed only on the 2nd rotation. 484 gems not good enough? Let’s make it 600 with only 1 guaranteed units so unlucky few will have to chose between cool unit that everyone have waited for and final boss cheese. Superawakening? What used to be terrible is still really bad. You still need more copies to have it cheaper and I’d wager that ppl who can only pull one copy of a unit aren’t really swimming in coins. Rich get richer and poor get poorer all over again. That all not to mention more and more units being introduced with exponentially scaling ultimates. We have our taste of that with LV, more are soon to come. Powercreep is natural part of many multiplayer games, but I’ve never seen it being so disturbingly fast as it is here.

**So what’s your point again?**

Money that you spend in this game doesn’t give you anything, unless you spend A LOT. At least from my experience everything is so random and changes so quickly, that I don’t feel like monthly/weekly subs matter at all. I can have extra few hundred gems to pull and still end up with nothing, costumes I might buy will be for units that within few weeks get irrelevant and/or heavily countered by the new shiny toy. I could have the same results not spending a dime and have the same experience. At this point I feel like to really feel any difference I’d have to at least double my spendings, even that could be not enough if NM decides to crank up the speed even more. To me there are really 2 groups of players: whales and the rest. Doesn’t matter if you buy nothing or just some, we’re all on the same boat as category B customers.

I don’t want to tell anyone what to do with their own money, by all means spend as much as you like. For me that means not spending at all. I might be wrong and maybe pure F2P experience will be very different from what I expected, but in this game especially I absolutely don’t feel any value in the money I’m putting in. I’m not trying to start another uproar like we had with Lilia (look how great it all went in the end), nor am I recommending other people to join some sort of protest. You all have your own minds and you can make your own decisions. Whales gonna whale and “vote with your wallets” never changed anything anyway. I just wanted to write this all down to clarify my thoughts and make it easier for myself to stop spending money on this game. If this helped anyone else, more power to you. I know that those kind of thought were coming to me for some time now and I’ve been dismissing them or simply forgetting, so hopefully this post will serve as a reminder to me and maybe more people.

**WOW, you really did it, you stuck till the very end!** 

Here I’d like to personally thank my mom who always been there for me, my PE teacher from high school for coining a cool nickname for me that stuck, that nice gentlemen at the bakery who recommended me those cheesy pastries (they’re delicious) and to you dear reader, for avoiding responsibilities and spending time here with me debating the ethically questionable state of mobile gaming.

Falsely banned^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/irntok/falsely_banned/^"So a couple of days ago I logged in to 7DS Grand Cross and and got this:

I am using a non jailbroken IOS device, never launched the game in any emulator or done exploit abuse. Contacted support and they told me their system found an illegal program being used in my device but couldn't disclose which one.

I have been playing the game the same way for the past months and its very frustrating to be in this situation. I have been very supportive of this game since the beginning, usually spending money every week or so. To top it off this week alone I spent $200 just to finally get my hands on LV meli because apparently 800 gems are not enough to get a new character... Now I cant even play with him, besides missing out on all the free daily stuff during half anniversary. Looking at netmarble forums it seems I am not the only one: [https://forum.netmarble.com/7ds\_en/view/29/51599](https://forum.netmarble.com/7ds_en/view/29/51599)

Enhanced each piece to 5* for a total 6 fully awakened 5* pieces of gear. 

Total resource cost: 

14,000,000g

3,000 Red Stones

90 5* Awakening Stones

Do to failure rates the cost of Gold and Red Stones may fluctuate in either direction so keep that in mind.

So for a full multi worth of gems from enhancing gear you would need approximately

70,000,000g

15,000 red stones 

450 5* Awakening stones

Give or take luck with failure rates.

Hopefully this gives anyone considering using 5* equipment to farm gems a decent look at the resource required to do so."^73^2020-09-13 03:11:37^103

Final Boss Escanor Hell Guide with Mono.^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/irw6sl/final_boss_escanor_hell_guide_with_mono/^"This guide will be for the Mono users in here regarding the Final Boss Escanor Hell. I will attempt the Derieri strategy too and see how many attemps and how hard or easy that one is.

The team I used for this and I found is the most efficient and ""easiest"". I will post screen-shot of my team below.

# Phase 1 : Green Escanor Abilities

* This phase he uses all of the Green Escanor abilities and passive with addition of the 2 new ones he is granted which is a buff and AoE attack that has 5000% multiplier if you have any buff applied on you.
* Push down Escanor as fast as possible to the immunity phase by using the Ultimate Gauge to your advantage with Mono and this should trigger when his health reaches 30%. While he is in his Immunity Stance you want to keep the team topped of with full health and try to have Mono/Elizabeth's ultimates available once his immunity worns off. Escanor will always target Mono if you have placed her on the left side of the team. You can let Mono tank the ultimate because after his ultimate and one AoE attack the turn ends. But keep in mind he wont oneshot her (depending on your gear). So now his immunity is gone, what you want to do here is to use Elizabeth ultimate and have entire team at full health and straight into a Mono nuke which should end phase 1.
* If you have good *RNG* during this run you want to have a silver shield from Elizabeth saved for phase 2.

# Phase 2 : Red Escanor Abilities.

* First turn you want to get rid of all bad cards like bronze Elizabeth stun or Mono ultimate seal because neither of those 2 abilities works on the second phase.
* Second turn if possible you want to apply shield and Mono buff removal cards. Starting from this turn you want to get him down to immunity stance as fast as possible because holding off onto the ultimates will take far too many turns meanwhile Mono already deals big damage with her passive, so do not rely on the ultimates that much for phase 2. Dont try to get nuked by Escanor's ultimate until you drop him to immunity.
* You have now succesfully made him reach immunity and he is about to use his ultimate but do not worry because you have the passive from Goddess Elizabeth to keep your character alive. During these 2 turns while has immunity you want to stay alive with your team meaning you have to play around with the shields and heals. Safe to say that bronze card or even silver card from Escanor's ""Charge Fire"" depending on your Elizabeth's stats will not be enough to go through the shield.
* Remember that Escanor's new ability has 5000% rupture multiplier and can one-shot you if you have any buffs applied. That is fine because Elizabeth's shields lasts for 1-2 turns depending on the card rank and Escanor only uses that AoE ability **EVERY 3 TURNS,** by knowing this you can keep track of when he is going to use that ability so even Elizabeth's ultimate is very useful here as you can keep the entire team alive.
* Lastly by trying to survive during his immunity stance you have to hope for some Mono damage cards otherwise there is no way to take him down. But even if you get her cards make sure to only attack him when he has more than 5 ultimate gauge because all of her damage depends on that.

*Hopefully this will help you out on this Final Boss. Also to notify I have tried using Small Blue Diane and she could work but mine was not level 80 so she did not work for me that well.*

Is Goddess Elizabeth banner really worth to pull on?^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/is1210/is_goddess_elizabeth_banner_really_worth_to_pull/^"Ok goddess Liz is a good unit and we know that LostVayne would be on her banner but if you pull and then you are out of gems then what? On JP 2 Festival units were released in the short period of 2 months Goddess Liz and Winged king.

My question is since most possibly winged king will come VERY shortly after goddess liz's banner why waste 900 gems(if really unlucky) on 1 copy of a unit that would also be again available after a short ammount of time? Liz is meta ngl she pairs well in ult rush with LV and Gowther But that is pretty much about it. While winged king and hendrikson are meta combined with the awakened red Lilia hooo boi things are getting hot in here.

What i'am trying to say is Should F2P really invest into Goddess Liz's banner? Winged king with Demon Hendrikson are way more meta than one goddess Elizabeth. Also would you rather have spended 900 gems on a unit that is meta on jp and works precisely well/king/ or would you rather use the gems on liz's banner and don't have enough for Winged king and Awakened Lilia later on. /that is only for the F2P playerbase the whales they have no problem going on BOTH banners/ /ETA: untill both units come to global would be aproximetely 6 months together Liz in 4 months 5 and half for King and 6 months for R lilia/ (that is a guesstimate)

Anyhow i hope you understand what i am trying to say i hope you would consider what's best for you. For me i will have to save 1500 gems(for King and Lilia's banners) when they come to global untill then I'm skipping EVERY banner. Missing a Festival unit?/king's banner/ Missing OC character?/Lilia's banner./

Have a nice day and may RNGesus be with you!"^0^2020-09-14 04:12:41^111

Fort Solgres Half Stamina Now Running (09/12/20 & 09/13/20)^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/ir7wgz/fort_solgres_half_stamina_now_running_091220/^"**Fort Solgres Enhance and Evolve Dungeons can be run for half stamina and increased gold drops from September 12th until September 13th.**

The stamina decrease and gold boost makes this event a great opportunity to gain a lot of gold by farming for books; and for leveling characters by farming for hero enhance potions.

**FORT SOLGRES EVENT QUICK TIPS**

* Unless there's a specific colour you need, red book stages are considered the best choice to farm due to their ease and speed
* The best difficulty level to farm is the highest one your team can comfortably auto
* You can find general and book specific farming team builds [here](https://www.sdsgc.gg/teams/pve)
* If you're OK with sacrificing some speed, consider putting a unit you need to boost affection for in the sub slot of your farming team
* You can buy stamina potions in the Coin Shop for 1 silver or 400 friendship coins each
* For auto farmers, make sure to check that your inventory has enough free space before you start
* Once the event ends, simply sell any excess books you have directly from your inventory; they cannot be sold to village merchants
* Veronica's buff cannot be used to increase books sale value
* I recommend keeping hold of any 5\* books or upgrading them to 6\* when/if you need them/the space as they are the hardest to get
* Ideally you shouldn't convert XP potions to higher levels as you lose out on some XP value in favour of saving on gold cost

**If anyone has any further tips for the event, or farming books/potions, please leave them below.**

Happy farming!"^23^2020-09-12 19:00:16^113

Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross Beginners Guide by Staff Team^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/iqyewq/seven_deadly_sins_grand_cross_beginners_guide_by/^"# 1) I am new to the game and I don't know what to do?

* Do the story ASAP (you will get updated dailies due to this with very valuable rewards).
* **In chapter 3 you will unlock Blue King,  who is one of the best support units in the game.**  
**In chapter 4 you will unlock Blue Giant Diane who can be used as your farm unit early on.**
* Once you start to struggle with your story progression, I would highly recommend to use a friend's unit (Mercenary unit) that can easily clear the fight. You can add friends by using one of our channels on the Discord Server **#friend-id-asia-glb.** We have hundreds of player IDs in there and will help you clear hard stages faster.

# 2) How do I get more diamonds?

\- You get 30 diamonds for finishing 100% of the quests given to you in every chapter town.

\- You get 1 diamond by reaching level 3 of a characters affinity, you do this by giving them specific food requested and ale from the tavern.

\- You get 5-10 diamonds for every 5 affection hearts in the affection's menu by using your characters in PvE stages **(1 stamina = 1 affection).** During 50% stamina you still gain the amount of the original stamina cost of the stage as affection.You can also give them gifts where they are located as NPCs in the chapters or tavern. 500 per day and 5000 during their birthday.

\- You get X amount of diamonds on a weekly basis from PvP ungeared ranking. (**Up to 60 diamonds at Champion 1 league).**

\- You get 1 diamond from Knighthood prayer (atleast 20 guild members have to pray daily for it to be given). You will unlock Knighthood after clearing chapter 6 (episode 73). This is a part of the daily missions and those also give you 4 diamoinds.

\- Diamonds are also given through achievements and the points from there too.  
\- You can get 2 diamonds for completing 100% of the achievements in the Battle Events menu.  
\- You can get 0-3 diamonds by watching the advertisements from Fort Solgares by doing the wheel spin.

# 3) What gear equipment should I use on my characters.

* DPS Characters = **ATK&DEF (4 pieces ATK, 2 pieces DEF)**
* Support Characters = **HP/DEF** **(4 pieces HP, 2 pieces DEF)**
* It does not matter which pieces you use as long as you get the set bonus. You have to option to share the same gear to other characters in this game.   
A good example for this is to mention Blue Lilia and Red Howzer who both are in need of the **Pierce Sub-Stat** for the **Bracelet** and **Ring** slot.
* If you want to share the gear between the two you can use a **DEF Bracer/Ring**. As most people will use Lilia on **HP/DEF** and Howzer on **ATK/DEF** the common part between them is the **DEF** gear.

# 4) I need gear & how do I acquire it.

* You can buy Common Rarity equipment for your right side slots from the town vendors. ( You are able to reroll the substats to max efficiency by using gold instead of Diamonds or Anvils.) Rerolling with gold is available on the rarities from Common to Rare. Dont buy the equipment packs from the shop because the substat rolls are always random and every main base roll is random.
* Every 2 weeks there is an event with 50% stamina the entire week. One of the areas include **""Free-Stage""** and this is where you are able to farm equipment during this 50% stamina. While doing this you also want to grab every single **Red Quest** which you get from the towns.  
Every 8 runs you will get one guaranteed SSR equipment, but you have to accept the quest again once you hand it in. There is no limit to how many times you can take the quests though.
* Make sure your SSR pieces have atleast **90% base stat** before you start awakening them.  
**- Town 1 offers ATK set.**  
**- Town 2 offers DEF set.**  
**- Town 3 offers HP set.**

# 5) What rarity of equipment do I need on my characters?

* **SSR Equipment on the left side** because upgrading and awakening those give you immensely higher stat boost of the base stat.  
**C equipment on the right side** awaken your Ring and Orb to 5\*. (Do not +5 them as it costs tons of red stones).  
Dont either replace your right side C equipment with SSR until you complete Bracelet and Belt for your main team.
* You will need a decent substat roll on your right side SSR equipment to outperform the C equipment. **Also do not awaken your SSR Necklace and Earrings,** keep them at +5 only until you finish the main 4 pieces **(Bracelet,Belt,Ring and Orb).**
* The upgrade order for the equipment goes as follows :  
**ATK/DEF : Bracelet > Belt > Ring > Orb >>>>>> Necklace > Earring.**  
**HP/DEF : Belt > Bracelet > Orb > Ring >>>>> Necklace > Earring.**
* What substats do you reroll?  
**Bracelet & Ring - ATK %**  
**Necklace & Earring - DEF%**  
**Belt & Orb - HP%**
* Some units are specified to have different substats like previously mentioned Howzer needing Pierce instead of Attack due to his skill relying on Pierce.

# 6) What characters should I level up.

* You need one main DPS character so you are able to farm rest needs to be supporters around the character to make it as safe as possible. In the Fort Solgres dungeon you have all 3 attributes opened at anytime for books and XP potions. You farm the Books to awaken your characters into UR-Rarity.  
*Use Kings conversion at the tavern to get 6\* books.*

# 7) How do I gain more CC.

* You gain CC by upgrading Equipment, Evolving , Limit Breaking characters , Awakening characters and upgrading Ultimate Levels. (400 CC per ultimate level). Cosmetics also give you CC. Other substats give very small amount of CC that is barely noticeable.
* **100% of ATK is carried over to the CC.**  
**75% of the DEF is carried over to the CC.**  
**20% of HP is carried over to the CC.**

# 8) How do I awaken my characters?

* To awaken your characters you need to farm ""Awakening Materials"" and they drop from specific free stages and boss battles in each chapter. Ontop of that you need to farm **Water of Life** and **Demon's Blood** which drop from Boss Battles as well as Demon Raids.
* All Sins and Elizabeth require Water of Life and everyone else uses Demon Blood.
* You can find the drop location of the material that you need by clicking on it in the awakening menu > location > go to.Some materials can drop in multiple stages.

# 9) Demons.

* Demons are co-op raids for 2 players which can be unlocked by progressing the story.Demons currently have 4 difficulties Easy - Hard - Extreme - Hell (last one being added on Global later this week).  
**Red Demon is unlocked after Chapter 5 and drops Red Demon's Horn.**  
**Grey Demon is unlocked after Chapter 6 and drops Grey Demon's Wings.**  
**Crimson Demon is unlocked after Chapter 7 and drops Crimson Ears.**
* These materials are needed to limit break your character up to level 80, you will need a total of 50 materials from each demon to achieve this.
* **60-65 Limit Break** : 30 R pendants / 10 SR Pendants / 3 SSR pendants, 1 6\* book, 20 Red Demon's Horns.  
**65-70 Limit Break** : 30 R pendants / 10 SR pendants / 3 SSR pendants, 1 6\* book, 10 Red Demon's Horns, 20 Grey Demon Wings.  
**70-75 Limit Break** : 30 R pendants / 10 SR pendants / 3 SSR pendants, 1 6\* book, 20 Red Demon's Horns, 20 Crimson Ears.  
**75-80 Limit Break** : 30 R pendants / 10 SR pendants / 3 SSR pendants, 1 6\* book, 30 Grey Demon's Wings , 30 Crimson Ears.

# 10) What are Association Characters?

* Association characters can be set to every character on the current team that you are using. These associations give **5-10% of their ATK,HP and DEF** to the linked character depending on the ultimate level. You do not gain other substats such as Pierce or Crit Rate.  
At 1/6 Ultimate Level you will get 5% of the stats while a character at 6/6 Ultimate Level will give 10% of their stats.
* Some characters have **Combined Ultimates \[Fate Links\]** with their associated character. You can notice this by seeing 2 swords crossed as a symbol when applying an association.  
Fate Link gives you a flat CC gain of **1000 CC.**
* You also gain a bonus stat from these associations.(For example Merlin gives Escanor 19.2% Crit Rate if you set Merlin as Escanor's link).

# 11) What are Passives and how do they work?

* A passive is an ability that every character has. You can unlock these by reaching 16000 CC and clearing their trial battle which highlights at the character's menu.  
Most character's passives works at the sub slot of the main team meaning they don't actively have to be on the field to trigger the passives.

# 12) Are cosmetics important in this game?

* Yes ,the cosmetics are very important as they provide bonus stats when registered each time you unlock one cosmetic. A maximum of 5 cosmetics can be registered per slot and there are 3 slots for cosmetics which goes by following **Armor - Weapon - Helmet/Head.**
* In general you should only be prioritizing UR cosmetics from the Sacred Treasure Shop and ignore the SSR and SR rarity. You can also buy them for free over at PvP shop once you have enough amount of PvP coins. Over time you will unlock all PvP cosmetics.

# 13) Which cosmetics should I prioritize?

* You should always prioritize event cosmetics over permanent ones. Cosmetics should be bought for your main PvP Team first and longevity characters. Headpieces and weapons first priorities.
* Headpieces give the biggest boost in CC for your ungeared team, followed by weapon and at last armor. You gain a free UR costume by evolving a character to UR rarity ( level 60 ). You can use the same cosmetics on the other versions of that character for example you can use Blue Merlin's cosmetics onto the Green Merlin. You get a free SSR cosmetic by maxing the affinity of a character to level 5.
* **- R character requires 12000 Affinity.**  
**- SR character requires 16000 Affinity.**  
**- SSR character requires 20000 Affinity.**

# 14) Food.

* Food is one of the biggest parts of 7DS Grand Cross. You can cook food with Ban in the tavern by using 3 ingredients (Do not use Meliodas). Cooking with Ban will give you between 3 to 5 meals everytime you cook depending on your luck but you can level up these recipies which eventually give you big stacks of meals when cooking up to 20 or more.
* In the bottom left of the Cooking Menu shows you all the meals you can cook and the ingredients needed as well as the benefits of eating them before the battles. You can farm these ingredients by clearing Free Stages in which they are dropped.
* You should always farm the lowest difficulty when farming food , even if you can clear higher difficulties. This is due to saving as much stamina as possible. You can also unlock Titles later on which gives you stat boost as long as you have the Titles equipped.
* *We hope this beginners guide was well written and very in depth of information needed to get you started on this journey. If there is anything wrong in here or needs correction, or even new additions just comment below.*

Releasing 6 units (must have and propably limited cosmetics) after LV cash grab banner is very... Kinda hard to find right word.^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/iqo34y/releasing_6_units_must_have_and_propably_limited/^"7ds even thou is great game overall and stands out in every other gacha world, i'd say netmarble is being netmarble. LV banner is pretty much cash grab. No rate up and 900 diamonds guaranted. I went in into this banner because I know how good LV is, not only in pvp wise but also boss battle farm. I'm at 438 diamonds in and my plan was to pull up to 900 by the end of this banner with my f2p diamonds + I bought 1month sub reach the goal, and today netmarble announced Hell Raids with 6 new characters I need to have, to stay relevant... 3 of them need x2 cosmetics 30 diamonds each.
I know that not only f2p players will struggle but also semi-payers or whales. This game isn't cheap lol. Diamonds cost alot of $ tbh, in price of 60 diamonds (7 days sub) I can buy great skin in LoL or month sub on PS4 or buy food for a whole week or pay for netflix month sub or month sub in Dofus which unlock everything with 100% cosmetics in IS. In price of 250 diamonds Rank Up I can buy a year sub on PS4, buy FULL game with DLCs for example FF14, GW2 or buy Prime Pack in Warframe with 2.5k Platinum which is fu*king alot (80% of end game warframes, modes and stuff can be bought for it). In Clash of Clans price of Seasion pass is half of price Hawk Pass and offers 10x value than Hawk pass which is insane. 
With all respect to netmarble but 7ds is rather cashgrab than not, lately. 
I enjoyed 7ds since launch but the frequency of banners and updates is too fast peaced for players who wanna play for fun and be relevant in each content. 
Oh well, I ended up on writing a rant lol

In your opinion, is the game F2P or P2W?^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/iqpth9/in_your_opinion_is_the_game_f2p_or_p2w/^"This is not a hate post about the game, just to clarify. I still like it a lot, just started thinking more about how it works and i'm kinda disappointed.

So, i started playing SDS after dropping two other gachas, DB Legends and Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links. I really liked the graphics, the mechanics, the characters, and the game (SDS) got me playing for hours every day. Getting characters is hard, and upgrading them is even harder (specially for new players, like me), but i have a lot of fun doing these things on this game, cause i'm still in love with its mechanics, graphics, etc. But i started comparing SDS to other gacha games i dropped..

First, let's talk about DB Legends. I dropped Legends cause the 2nd anniversary was a complete joke and the game  was going full p2w and cashgrab mode, with things like Zenkai Awakening (buff on old characters that you actually need to pay to use), or Red Star system (increasing the maximum level of stars from 7 to 14, increasing the gap between f2p and p2w). But.. isn't Super Awakening the same thing? It came on an anniversary as it was something good, but is it really necessary? Isn't it a p2w and unnecessary mechanic that came just to incentive more people to use money? I know the system got revamped, but why does it need to exist? And also, dupes do help a lot on your CC, and it's not easy to get them when your game has 3% rates, usually 0.500% or less for 1 new character. Legends has 10% rates, 1% for new characters (minus Legends Limited units, that are 0.25%) and ""low rates"" was one of the things that made me drop Legends. Also, i hated the fact that Legends was dropping banners nonstop, and SDS has been doing the same thing continuously.

Now about Duel Links. The game has something called ""banlist"" where they limit or ban certain cards to ""balance"" the game and ""help"" the meta, but everyone who plays know that their banlists makes no sense and are horrible for f2p. Having two of my favorite decks getting hit by the banlist made me think that the game was heavily p2w and i quitted. But, Duel Links was the only game where i managed to reach the highest rank on pvp and play at a high level multiple times being 100% f2p. Now to SDS. I'm stuck on Master 5 ungeared because my CC is too low cause i can't afford the cosmetics, that are expensive as fuck (some pieces have the price of one multi, lol). Isn't it kinda stupid to have to use so much in game currency not only to get the characters (since the rates are so low), but also to get their clothes and weapons? I know you can get some for free, but this is so stupid.

This is NOT a hate post, i just want to have a nice and calm discussion with you guys, i want to know your opinions and how is the game for endgame people and all."^5^2020-09-12 00:49:55^130

My F2P guide for farming Hard difficulty FB Escanor^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/iqfda4/my_f2p_guide_for_farming_hard_difficulty_fb/^"Firstly, I'm not a native speaker, so don't judge my writing too strictly.
Secondly, It's not a guide for the highest score, but a guide for farming a Costume.
Let's start with units - you'll need Red Gowther and Blue Fighter Diane at the front, Matrona in the back and some ult remove Unit (I used Blue Lillia). I don't have Mono, so I've made this simple guide.
My Gowther had UR HP and Defence gear, but If you have Blue Lilia she will heal him up through the battle, because Gowther will be used as a tank(although mainly we need his rank ups).
BF Diane will need Attack and Def, so her Attack will be about 10k(you don't need to level 80 her for that, mine is 60).
Matrona is needed for that extra 25 base stats on Diane, so I've put her in the back.
Also, use Lifesteal food, because fight will be long.
Phase 1 will be easy, so our main objective is to prepare for nuke on Phase 2.
For nuke in Phase 2 we need at least Gold Rupture and Gold Buff Remover on Diane(that's why is Gowther there). Escanor will DeRank cards with his Red Attack(with specific red border), so don't rush, take it easy. Remove Escanor Ult, and wait for Diane's to fill up.
When you're set use your ults(REMEMBER Escanor has Immunity when his HP gets less than 30%, so Nuke him with Diane's ult for the most damage).
In Phase 2 firstly use your Gold Buff Remover Diane Card and Dump some cards for Bronze attack Diane Buffs.
With 10k attack base, Diane with her Gold Rupture should  deal around 105-110k damage, so calculate your damage to nuke Escanor ignoring his immune on 30% HP.
Notice you Nuke him when he has 3 buffs(we removed 50% HP-Rel stats on first Turn Phase 2 with Buff Remover).
For this tactic you'll need to get lucky, but it has some kind of good winrate and works for me at least. While farming using this strategy max points that I've got were atound 1100 and I had Lvl 80(2/6 2* Super Awakening) Gowther, Lvl 60(1/6 w/o Super Awakening) Diane and Lvl 60(3/6 3* Super Awakening) Lillia."^13^2020-09-11 11:53:25^140

Idea: A simple Skill Point System^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/iq5o47/idea_a_simple_skill_point_system/^"So I was thinking about some units that are barely used or just bad in general. The easiest way to make them better is by buffing them, but that would maybe cause them to be to strong or still to weak (like Mono).

In my opinion the best way would be to let the player decide, how the unit needs to be buffed and that´s where the Skill Point system comes in place.

**First let me explain the system:**

I was thinking about tieing it to the CC of the character like the uniques. So a character gets the unique with 16kCC, a Skill Point with 24kCC, another one with 32kXX and the last one with 40kCC.

Every Skill Point can be put in a Stat-Bonus of your choosing, so one Skill Point gives you the following:

1. \+10% Attack
2. \+10% HP
3. \+20% Defense
4. \+20% Crit Chance/Crit Damage/Resistence/Pierce/Healing Rate/Resistence against Crit
5. \+10% Defense against Crit/Lifesteal
6. \+5% Regeneration Rate

(Of course you don´t get everything with a single skillpoint what is mentioned in 4th and 5th, just wanted to keep the list small.)

That means you can either put all your skill points in one stat (= 3 Skill Points into Attack -> 30% more attack) or balance it between three different Stats.

&#x200B;

**Why do I think this is a good idea?**

As mentioned before, many characters are useless or only used for specific content. With the ability to buff them the way you want, some characters can be used more often or make specific content easier because you can use more characters.

&#x200B;

**How to make it not to OP?**

Maybe that it the aspect I was thinking the most about.

Enabling Skill Points in every aspect of the game (PvP geared and ungeared, Story, Final Boss, Tower of Trials, Farming and so on) would make the system irrelevant. Especially in PvP oriented Modes.

So my idea here is simply only enabling it for PvE content (excluding Co-op gameplay like Deathmatches).

This way PvE is accessible for everyone, even if you are not an active player (by switching gear to get 40kCC on any character) but PvP and Scoreboards stay the same, just like the HP Box Buff (So it also doesn´t count into the Knighthood CC.)

&#x200B;

**Some other ideas:**

1. The stat boost depends on the base rarety of the Unit, meaning a R character gets a 15% ATK, 15% HP, 30% DEF Boost (and so on), a SR character 10/10/20 and a SSR character 5/5/10. This way R and SR characters get way better.
2. Skill Points can be toggled on or off, before a fight with a simple tap. Disabling Skill Points, everything is normal. Enabling Skill Points will disabling Gold Chest Drops, meaning you can´t farm Half Stamina Events with Skill Points activated or grind the Final Boss Exchange Materials too easy.

&#x200B;

So I am excited to read your thoughts about this System, maybe even other ideas to balance it with still having an impact."^0^2020-09-11 03:36:14^172

In what scenarios is triple crit/triple defense worth?^https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/ipo3kj/in_what_scenarios_is_triple_crittriple_defense/^"Yes yes I know “mega thread!” But I’ve asked this question before and didn’t get an in depth answer so I’m guessing it’s a bit too complicated for the mega thread 

I plan on creating UR gear for Gowther soon and while I’ve been told triple defense is better for GB and Hp/def is better for general use nobody ever explains how much better or which one is overall the best UR choice. I’m also not even sure if triple defense lets you patience on extreme difficulties.

Likewise I plan on gearing Gking soon and I’ve heard debate about triple crit vs atk def but would just generally like to know if (and when) triple crit is the answer vs atk defense

But in my end calculation, it came out that I would be consuming 500 stam pots just the boss battles alone with half stam reduction. The calculation: 24 hours x 3 days (length of the boss battle stam reduction) x 60 minutes x 10 (stamina for each battle) x1 (assuming that it's a minute run)/80 (the max stamina I have) = 540 stam pots.

9. Filter by flair now working/sidebar links updated
10. Accounts with -50 comment karma or below will be automatically filtered

Hey folks,

You may have noticed these changes already (I hope), but in the interest of full transparency and letting you all know what the mod team has been working on over the past month, here is a breakdown of all the recent changes to r/SDSGrandCross.

# 1. RULE CLARIFICATIONS

Based on community feedback, we have made some amendments to the rules in order to make them clearer and hopefully easier to understand.

You can always find the rules in the sidebar of the sub on desktop Reddit, by swiping right/pressing ""About"" on the Reddit app, or on the [Rules wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/wiki/rules).

Here is a list of the changes:

**Additions to Rule 2:**

* *Posts must be flaired correctly*
* *You can find guidelines on what content is allowed for each flair* [*here*](https://bit.ly/3bq6Bhu)

**Additions/changes to Rule 3:**

*- Examples of low effort content include but are not limited to:*

* *Screenshots of basic/unremarkable gameplay features or that require further explanation*
* *Memes lacking image editing*
* *Memes lacking SDSGC related imagery*

\- Removal of the Megathread links

**New Rule:**

*Rule 7: Use The Appropriate Megathreads*

*All threads should be posted in their respective Megathreads if they exist. These include:*

* [*Friend Codes*](https://bit.ly/31Sdntb)
* [*Knighthood Recruitment (Global)*](https://bit.ly/2F1ucc5)
* [*Knighthood Recruitment (JP)*](https://bit.ly/2QU9QnP)
* [*Basic Questions, Advice, & Discussion*](https://bit.ly/2U63wvD)
* [*Achievements, Pulls, or Drops*](https://bit.ly/3hkST1k)
* [*Song Requests*](https://bit.ly/34IraEN)

# 2. THREAD POSTING GUIDELINES

In relation to feedback around Rule 2 and an increase in posts being flaired incorrectly, we have developed the ""Thread Posting Guidelines"".

They can be found under Rule 2 in the sidebar of the sub on desktop Reddit, by swiping right/pressing ""About"" on the Reddit app, on the [Thread Posting Guidelines wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/wiki/thread-posting-guidelines), and linked in the daily Megathread.

In addition to providing guidelines as to what type of content suits each flair, there is also a brief step-by-step guide on [""how to insert an image into a comment""](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/wiki/thread-posting-guidelines#wiki_how_to_insert_an_image_into_a_comment) for those who are unaware.

We are hoping that this will help clear up any confusion about what to flair your content and how to insert images into comments.

# 3. QUESTION FLAIR CHANGES

You should already be aware of this based on the previous post around the [Question Flair & Megathread Feedback Survey Results](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/im1pil/question_flair_megathread_feedback_survey_results/), but in order to keep all the changes in one place; based on the responses to the survey and from a discussion to work out what is both beneficial for the sub as well as practical and manageable for the mods to deal with, we instated the following changes:

**1.** **Only the following topics are permitted to be posted using the ""question"" flair**

* Questions about confirmed upcoming content
* Questions about new content released that week
* Strategy related e.g death match/boss teams/best farming strats etc

**All** other questions must go in their respective Megathreads.

**2.** **All question flair posts now require mod approval**

We have set up a filter that notifies the mods when a post with a question flair has been submitted. They will then check it and approve it if it complies with the sub rules.

This is to help enforce the sub rules and to ensure that the Automod message is not ignored; giving the poster the opportunity to post their question in the Megathread if it does indeed belong there, and helping break the habit of users answering question posts that break the rules.

This information can also be found in the [Thread Posting Guidelines wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/wiki/thread-posting-guidelines) which is linked under Rule 2 in the sidebar of the sub, by swiping right/pressing ""About"" on the Reddit app, or linked in the daily Megathread.

# 4. BASIC QUESTIONS, ADVICE, & GENERAL DISCUSSION MEGATHREAD CHANGES

As mentioned in the previous post around the [Question Flair & Megathread Feedback Survey Results](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/im1pil/question_flair_megathread_feedback_survey_results/), in order to help reduce the amount of basic questions being submitted, and to help users potentially find answers faster and easier, we have updated the post content of the Megathread based on the feedback from Question 4 of the survey and what the mods feel would be helpful.

The content is, as always, subject to change and we welcome any feedback about any additions or changes you feel would be beneficial to it.

# 5. MENU BAR

We have a menu bar now! This can be found at the top of the subreddit, or by pressing ""Menu"" on the Reddit app.

Here you can find links to the following:

* r/SDSGrandCross Wiki
* Latest patch notes for GLOBAL and JP
* All the Megathreads
* General FAQ and Event FAQs
* Useful websites e.g official SDSGC and databases
* Customer Support links and guide

We're hoping that the increased visibility of these resources will be of greater benefit to the community, and help users searching for answers to potentially find them faster.

# 6. GENERAL FAQ/WIKI

As mentioned above, we have been putting some more work into the wiki in an effort to better utilise it as a helpful resource for the community.

This is a massive undertaking, and one that will be ongoing, but here are some of the immediate changes:

* Index updated with helpful links such as subreddit rules, thread posting guidelines, FAQs, official websites, guides and more
* A new [General FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/wiki/faq) based on the content of my old Weekly MegaFAQs. It should provide answers for the majority of newbie questions, and will be regularly updated

The overall idea for the future of the wiki is that if there's a resource you need to find and you're not sure where it is, you should be able to find it in the [Wiki Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/wiki/index).

# 7. WELCOME MESSAGE

We have set up an automated welcome message that gets DMd to any user who joins the sudreddit. It includes a welcome message, a copy of the rules, and a list of useful links to help them get started.

We're hoping that this helps welcome new users into the community, and allows them to easily understand things like the flairs and the question system by having all that information sent directly to them when they join.

If you are a new user who has received this welcome message and have any feedback for us about it, please do [get in touch](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/SDSGrandCross)!

# 8. BASIC QUESTION CHAT

For those looking for somewhere to potentially get an answer to their question faster, the sub now has a [Basic Question Chat](https://www.reddit.com/chat/r/sdsgrandcross/channel/14975393_17c293568483c141d350e64d8f38dbb10471a60c).

Access to this can found in the sidebar on desktop Reddit, or by touching ""Rooms"" on the Reddit app.

# 9. SIDEBAR UPDATES

* The previous post flair filter widget in the sidebar wasn't working correctly. This has now been updated and fixed.
* The ""Important Links"" widget has been updated with additional relevant links to various megathreads and PSAs

# 10. COMMENT KARMA FILTER

This last one is a bit ""inside baseball"" but in the spirit of full transparency, if your Reddit account has a comment karma of -50 or less, anything you post to the sub will be filtered first for approval.

This has been set up as a deterrent to troll accounts. The number has been set at a point that we believe it shouldn't affect any new members/accounts who may have a rough start with posting things in the wrong places. It is also the reason why the content has been set to filtered and not instantly removed or banned.

&#x200B;

**I believe that pretty much covers everything so far! Hopefully these changes are proving to be beneficial, and you have already seen an improvement in the quality of the sub.**

**I just want to thank again everyone who has ever taken part in one of the surveys as it's absolutely invaluable to us to ensure that we are making changes that have the best interests and wishes of the community at its center.**

**It's been almost a month since the initial ""**[**State of the Sub**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSGrandCross/comments/i88fow/farewell_to_a_mod_results_of_the_subreddit/)**"" survey so we're probably due for a follow-up soon to get a good comparison of where we are now to where we were. Your feedback is really important to us so please keep an eye out for that.**

**As always, if you have any feedback around these changes, or suggestions about the sub overall, please leave them in the comments below or** [**send the mods a message**](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/SDSGrandCross)**.**"^33^2020-09-09 19:00:10^185
